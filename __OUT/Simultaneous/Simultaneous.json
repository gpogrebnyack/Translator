Next session I’ll begin observational experiments with Brian.\n\n//\n\nSN: Tell me again about your symptoms. Have they persisted since we began?\n\nMARIGOLD: I haven’t collapsed again since that first incident, and I’m not missing time.\n\nSN: Good, that’s good.\n\nMARIGOLD: Yes. But the headaches, I’m still dealing with those.\n\nSN: What about the nightmares?\n\nMARIGOLD: Still having those, too.\n\nSN: Did you do like we discussed last week?\n\nMARIGOLD: I’ve kept a notebook on the nightstand, yes. But the nightmares don’t make sense in the context of reality.\n\nSN: That’s okay. They rarely do, you know. They’re just road maps to what you’re dealing with today. Or it’s whatever trauma carried over from before, like excess baggage, and now it’s arrived at your door.\n\nMARIGOLD: I get it. But, this feels like something else. Something … stranger.\n\nSN: I’m listening.\n\n[silence for several seconds]\n\nMARIGOLD: You know what the Mandela Effect is?\n\nSN: I’m familiar. You’re talking about a type of false memory shared by many people and believed to be fact.\n\nMARIGOLD: Yes.\n\nSN: Are you experiencing that lately?\n\nMARIGOLD: Not quite, no.\n\n[rustling of fabric]\n\nMARIGOLD: It’s a false memory, but no one else has it. And not relating to something meaningful, really. I went to a convention on Monday and I swore one of the speakers was a different person. Like, they had a speaker—this was for an app that helps track electronic and EM temperature spikes as an early-warning system for residential fires—anyway, the speaker was a man named Daryl.\n\nSN: Do you know him?\n\nMARIGOLD: No. I was certain the speaker was a woman named Alice. Like, I remember reading her bio in the program and thinking, “All right, another female face, yes.” She was from Boston, but other details were hazy.\n\nSN: Daryl replaced her?\n\nMARIGOLD: No. I mean—yes, I guess?\n\nSN: Sorry, keep going.\n\nMARIGOLD: I mean to say, there is no Alice. No one remembers her. I spoke with Daryl later, he said they don’t have an Alice at the company. She wasn’t in the program, either, even though I can remember her.\n\nSN: And you think you just had a dream about Alice speaking at the conference?\n\nMARIGOLD: Maybe. But my dreams are usually weirder, you know? Like, mixed in with the mundane setting there’s an ostrich tending bar or everyone starts singing. There’s always some element that makes it clear I’m dreaming. This felt more like a false memory.\n\n[shuffling of papers]\n\nMARIGOLD: I imagined her. And when I think about her too much, the headaches come back, stronger than ever.\n\nSN: Perhaps you knew her from before, or knew her family? We can explore it.\n\nMARIGOLD: This is all what’s developed since we started our sessions.\n\n[silence]\n\nMARIGOLD: I don’t think this is trauma that happened a long time ago. I mean, it feels like that sometimes, but also it feels new. Like something in my world broke, recently—last month—and it’s too much for me to handle so I’ve blocked it.\n\nSN: That’s how you got here. How you sought me out. I can help you with that, but I want to hear what has led you to this idea.\n\nMARIGOLD: Do you think I’m wrong? Am I just rationalizing or internalizing or whatever?\n\nSN: Don’t overthink it, just tell me what you’re feeling and we can navigate it together.\n\nMARIGOLD: I’ve also been having intense déjà vu. Like I’ve heard something already, or I recognize a person or a place on TV when I’ve never met them, never been there. I’ve had a version of this since forever, my mom called it some mystical intuition, but I’ve grown out of the person I was who believed in my mom’s worldview.\n\nSN: So what do you think this is?\n\n[silence]\n\nMARIGOLD: I’m a software engineer, and what we do in our line of work when we run into a problem we can’t crack is, we look online to see if it’s already been solved, or at least if others have encountered the same problem. And so that’s how I read about this quantum physics experiment that’s been repeated recently, using a type of light photon and a beam splitter. They call it the time-flip circuit. The experiment suggests that when this photon splits, it travels both forward and backward in time. Like an echo of the event is carried in both directions.\n\nThere’s no evidence of this sort of event happening beyond a closed experiment with a very specific particle, but … But what if something happened to me, and it’s affecting my past and my future at the same time?\n\nSN: What would that be?\n\nMARIGOLD: That is the scariest part. What if I will never know?",

      "content": "1. The Explosion Heard a Thousand Miles Away and a Day Before\n\nTHE EXPLOSION HEARD A THOUSAND MILES AWAY AND A DAY BEFORE\n\nThe place is called Ghost Ranch. A simple house made of adobe sits like an ancient relic, nestled in a snow-salted plain. Long shadows make giants of the stoic mesas in the distance. While the land and sky are painted in sun tones of the early morning, the world feels cold to the touch.\n\nA lone sedan slumbers in a lot nearby, its windows fogged, its tires and undercarriage dressed with dirt from a hundred highways.\n\nInside, Grant Lukather exhales warm air into his cupped hands and shakes off the night of restless sleep. He glances at his two-week beard and wrinkled clothes in the rearview mirror. He’s barely thirty-five, but looks older here. The interior smells of fast food and stale coffee, emanating from the small trash bin wedged in front of his passenger seat under the glove box.\n\nThe rear window is obscured by a suitcase propped up and tied down with a seat belt. Collared shirts dangle from hooks over the back doors. A small travel iron is bound by its own cord atop a small, collapsible board. It draws the eye—a talisman for tidiness and normalcy amid the chaos of the car-that-is-his-home. Like a crucifix in a drug den.\n\nGrant steps out into the brisk New Mexico air and stretches his back until his neck pops. His breath plumes like cigarette smoke. The countryside is quiet. Desolate. A wind scrapes over the plain, past him, and he adjusts his wrinkled coat.\n\nAn insistent chirp breaks the silence. Grant returns to his car, frowning. He digs into the center console and pulls up a cellular phone anchored to a charger. When he speaks, his voice cracks like he hasn’t talked out loud in several days.\n\n“This is Grant.”\n\nA baritone voice on the other end speaks to him. Grant senses an edge of trepidation in the man’s voice.\n\n“Grant. It’s me. Are you in town?”\n\n“No, I’m on the road.”\n\n“I thought I would call. We haven’t talked since the thing. But we got a flag. You don’t have to take it.”\n\nGrant clears his throat. “I can work. I’m ready to work. Where is it?”\n\nAs Grant listens to the instructions, he opens the glove box, where a Sig Sauer handgun rests atop a leatherbound notebook, pencil, and a small stack of insurance cards. He grabs the notebook, and while keeping the phone tucked between shoulder and ear, he writes the letters NM on a page, with some numbers and a name. On the previous page of the spread, the last thing written is a question in neat, small handwriting: Why am I still here? At the end, near the spine of the book, well beyond the question mark: a detailed sketch of a nine-millimeter bullet, its dimensions shadowed with crosshatch pencil marks.\n\nGrant clears his throat again and speaks into the phone: “That’s a two-hour drive from me. You said it originated as a nine-one-one call?”\n\n“I’ll forward you the recording. Get there in three hours if you want to catch the CST.”\n\nGrant makes a noncommittal noise and ends the call. In the ensuing silence, his gaze returns through the fogged windshield to the adobe house in the distance, beyond the sign over an arch that reads GHOST RANCH.\n\nGrant carefully eases out a folded note tucked in the back of his notebook. Unfolds it. Written on the colored paper, in gentler handwriting, is a list with a title at the top. “Artist Landmarks to Visit Before I Die.” Below, on the list, several locations have been crossed through with rough pencil.\n\nGrant marks through Ghost Ranch, New Mexico, and carefully folds the note again. He replaces everything methodically back into the glove box and starts the car. Its engine thrums to life, the heater kicking on immediately.\n\nAs the sedan makes its way out of the property, it passes a sign at the entry.\n\nHOME AND STUDIO OF GEORGIA O’KEEFFE!\n\n* * *\n\nThree hours later, Grant stares at his reflection in a locker-room mirror.\n\nHis hair is wet and slicked back. His most recent clothes are stuffed into a trash bag. Hanging from a shower stall door behind him is a garment bag with a suit. He recites a mantra in his head: There’s only so much you can do. There’s only so much you can do. He repeats it enough times, it feels less like programming and more like OCD. Grant’s voice is firm in his narration, but his eyes plead with him to stop; to strip off the suit and return to his lived-in travel clothes and crawl back into the hole he’d dug for himself in the dusty sedan.\n\nThere’s only so much you can do. There’s only so much you can do.\n\n“So, go do it,” Grant says to his reflection. His voice is still raw.\n\nHe slathers shaving foam over his beard and brings up a razor.\n\n* * *\n\nTwenty minutes later, Grant returns to his car outside a 24 Hour Fitness gym near Albuquerque. He tosses the trash bag of clothes he’d just worn in a bin on his way. With the exception of two other cars, the lot is unpopulated. The strip mall once contained a Blockbuster Video, but no other business has come to claim its spot, and so the shadow prints of the block letters remain, etched into the stucco by twenty years of sun damage. The only other survivors in this oversize shopping district are a nail salon, a convenience store, and a pawnshop.\n\nGrant holds up a small camera and takes a photo of the faded Blockbuster Video lettering.\n\n* * *\n\nSounds of traffic from a nearby expressway fill a small dog-walking park carpeted with mostly brown, dead grass. Grant bites into a deli sandwich on a bench, reading the remnants of a New York Times newspaper left by someone. In a suit, and clean-shaven, he seems almost professional. His hair still badly needs a cut, and his fingernails need trimming, but he comes off as someone on his first job interview after being displaced. “The move forces a vote within days on whether to keep the Speaker in his post,” he reads aloud. Getting more comfortable with his own voice. With his mask of confidence. “A challenge that only two other House Speakers have faced in the history of the chamber.”\n\nWhat he reads is inconsequential; it’s words on a page. Grant’s interest in the news is cursory and fleeting, only to introduce himself back into a world that pays attention to current events. As he continues, he adjusts his posture to seem more assertive. He wears the suit now, instead of the suit wearing him.\n\nThe sounds of hissing water and industrial air dryers fill this space—across the street, a full-service car wash is in full swing.\n\nA pair of uniformed employees with cloth rags wipe down Grant’s sedan. One of them looks up at the rising sun bearing down on the day. No cloud cover in sight.\n\nThe other employee waves his rag in the air.\n\nGrant takes the last bite of his sandwich and approaches.\n\n“Sir, this your car?”\n\nGrant nods.\n\n“We got it as clean as could be, but I don’t know what to tell you about this damage on the side here. You see this?”\n\nHe points at where the paint had blistered, cracked, and torn off. Plastic around the driver’s-side wheel well looked badly warped.\n\n“I see it.”\n\n“I don’t know what did this, but you’d have to go to the dealer to see if they can put a new coat on for you.”\n\nGrant gave the man a tip and took his car keys. “Fire.”\n\n“What, sir?”\n\n“It was fire damage.”\n\n* * *\n\nLess than ten minutes later, Grant’s cleaned-up sedan pulls into a suburban neighborhood called Sandia Heights.\n\nNo other part of New Mexico had felt populated except for those in their cars on the road; this is the first time Grant notices other people outside. On their lawns or in their driveways. Entire blocks of residents outside—wives holding umbrellas to shelter from the sun, husbands bent over with dust brooms or oven mitts, on their knees. Some cursing, some quietly in shock. One woman dabs her ear with a tissue.\n\nThat’s when Grant notices: All the glass in every home window has been blown out.\n\nEven car windows have shattered, leaving thousands of shards glinting in the sunlight.\n\nSome homeowners glare at Grant as he slows, passing them by.\n\nAt the end of a cul-de-sac, a line of emergency vehicles sits with their lights flashing. It feels like a dead end to nowhere. The housing development is unfinished here, with a wide-open view of the dirt and shrubs all the way to a mountain range that rises like a wall along the east.\n\nGrant pulls next to a squad car, boxing it in.\n\nBefore he’s fully stepped out, a uniformed officer steps to his door.\n\n“Sir, you can’t park there.”\n\nGrant pulls out an identification badge from his breast pocket and casually hands it to the officer. “I got the call on this a couple of hours ago.”\n\nThe officer reads Grant’s badge.\n\n“Homeland Security?”\n\nGrant plucks the badge from him and returns it to its home in Grant’s pocket.\n\nThe officer narrows his eyes. “I’m First Sergeant Beale, I was first officer on the scene. If you’re here about a gas main rupture, should I be worried?”\n\nGrant shrugs. “Let me do the worrying.” He steps past the man, toward the wilderness beyond this housing development. “Now, is the crime-scene tech still here?”\n\n* * *\n\nIn a field, the tall grass has flattened, all in the same direction.\n\nGrant stands and looks around him. He notices trees a quarter mile away collapsed atop one another like a thousand toppled dominoes.\n\nSomething detonated aboveground, close by.\n\n“Happened early this morning,” Beale says, catching up to Grant and pointing. “About half a mile from the plant. Over there. A team from the gas company was out working diagnostics when it blew.”\n\n“Casualties?”\n\n“A few, yeah. So far, just the workers. But it woke a lot of people up, that’s for sure.”\n\n“Hmm.”\n\nThe elevated pipeline stands out like a white line in the distance, before the earthy rise of the mountains beyond. From here, the material looks like a child’s toy; as if the pipeline were much closer but made of LEGO bricks, or some other plastic thing.\n\nBeale glances at Grant, curious about him. Noting the unruly hair over the back of his blazer and the small shaving cut under his chin.\n\n“I’ve never even heard of your agency. Predictive Analytics. That sounds more like some sorta research firm. So, uh, if you don’t mind me asking, how much of what I just told you did you already know?”\n\nGrant shrugs again. “Enough to be here.”\n\n* * *\n\nTwo hundred steps later, Grant and Beale arrive at a macabre, artistic scene. Ground zero. Two ends of the pipeline have bloomed like flower petals, leaving a gap the length of a dozen men laid head to foot. This is where the grass flattens out in a radius, creating a kind of clockface mosaic, but instead of analog clock hands, it’s deep black burns in a stripe from some thrown bit of debris.\n\nMost of the ground has flash-burned around it: The tips of grass and trees are burned, but the rest is untouched. Grant muses that this scene must look like a giant asterisk from a bird’s-eye view.\n\n“There’s only so much you can do,” he whispers. And what’s done is done, his thoughts continue as he scans the scene.\n\nA group of paramedics works with two men in light jackets that read CRIME SCENE TECH, all of them bent over, rooting around with metal rods or with their own gloved hands, seeking evidence.\n\nA series of plastic crime-scene trays have been lined up neatly on a folding table, where several dozen baggies of found evidence have been collected. Little neon-colored flags with numbers dot the area.\n\nIt’s time, he realizes. Time to go to work again. Grant holds his phone to his ear and one-touch dials a number.\n\nAs it rings on the other end, he ventures closer to the rupture and peers into one open end of the pipeline. It goes dark quickly.\n\n“Play the call,” Grant says to a voice on the other end.\n\nBeale steps to him with a questioning look on his face.\n\nGrant makes a snap decision and holds the phone before him, putting the call on speaker.\n\nBeale gets close in time to hear an automated female voice: “This message was recorded yesterday at eight fourteen A.M.”\n\nA moment later, the voices of two different women—first, the flat, businesslike emergency operator, followed by someone exasperated.\n\n“Nine-one-one, what is your emergency?”\n\n“There will be an explosion.”\n\n“Did you say an explosion?”\n\n“Tomorrow morning. On the edge of town, the Manover pipeline. It will kill seven people.”\n\n“Ma’am? Tomorrow?”\n\n“Please look into it. You can stop it.”\n\nA series of clicks ends the recording, and Grant ends the call.\n\n“Hang on—that was from yesterday?” Beale asks, nodding to Grant’s phone.\n\nGrant doesn’t directly answer, his mind focused on other questions. He replies with one for Beale. “Is there any evidence of an explosive device?”\n\n“Well, I mean…” Beale reluctantly gestures to the gas main. “The whole pipeline. But if you mean a bomb, I dunno.”\n\n“You said a crew was working here. Anyone else mixed in with them?”\n\n“If they were, they were dressed like the others. You can have a look yourself.”\n\n“I will. Thank you, Sergeant.”\n\nFirst Sergeant Beale follows him. “My guys will need to know soon. Either we start handing over paperwork or we just clean this up.”\n\nGrant frowns, momentarily confused. “Know what?”\n\n“Is this a federal case? Everyone’s waiting on you, Agent.”\n\nGrant looks around. Indeed, the other uniformed officers and two of the techs stare at him. Grant returns his attention to Beale. “Maybe.”\n\nGrant steps to where an ambulance has driven off the road to get close to the scene.\n\nThere, five bodies concealed in body bags are lined up while the coroner takes photographs.\n\n“Maybe not.”\n\nGrant begins to write 5 bodies, not 7 in his notebook.\n\nA whistle gets his and Beale’s attention: From the group of emergency vehicles back at the cul-de-sac, another officer hurries back.\n\nBeale calls to him, “Hollister! What’s up?”\n\nHollister calls back, “Just heard from the hospital!”\n\nBeale snaps his fingers, remembering. He brings Grant up to speed: “The pipeline foreman and another tech were alive when we got here. Rushed them to Saint Mary’s.” Calling out to Hollister: “Are they gonna make it?”\n\n“They both died on the table.”\n\nBeale looks back to Grant, eyes widening. That makes seven. But Grant is already on his phone again, marching back to where he parked his car.\n\n“This is Special Agent Grant Lukather calling in on the Manover case. I need the number used to make that nine-one-one call. You capture that information automatically, yes?”\n\nHe stops in his tracks a few steps later. Grant turns back, utterly baffled, and looks toward ground zero once more. He asks into his phone, “California? Are you sure?”\n\n* * *\n\nSanta Monica.\n\nSarah Newcomb watches news footage on her laptop. A helicopter hovers over the burst Manover pipeline as the chyron reads SEVEN DEAD IN GAS MAIN RUPTURE NEAR ALBUQUERQUE.\n\nSarah’s home is a contradiction of styles. The furniture and wallpaper project a restrained, almost-masculine presence. Dark hardwood. Glass tables with steel legs. Winter colors. But populating the spaces are vibrant, almost-childlike knickknacks and art. Fortune-teller beads dangling over the entry to the kitchen pantry. Coffee mugs of cartoon characters. A wall calendar of art featuring fantasy witches.\n\nSarah is dressed in a flowing skirt and a wrap over a small sleep shirt, nibbling on her blond hair looped around one finger, a nervous habit, as she watches the footage. Even at thirty-one, she looks like her driver’s-license photo from five years ago. She’s garnered friends in her life for many reasons, but the most endearing to many of them is her expressive face and bright eyes. She’s incapable of hiding her emotions, which makes her a terrible poker player in the same way it makes her a trustworthy confidante. Her closest friends have all been burned by deceit or lies from close partners, and being able to come to Sarah with a story or a problem and simply watching her reactions gives them a kind of soothing reassurance there is one person who’s always honest with them, even when she scrunches up her nose in disapproval or gasps in surprise.\n\nHer calendar is peppered with markers for birthdays of friends and extended family. Sarah is the type to send you a card or a text even if you haven’t spoken with her in months. Holidays are just as important, with Halloween receiving a triplet of exclamation marks and the nearest weekend blocked out for hypothetical costume parties. Her calendar app sits next to Etsy and other, more niche shopping apps for specific gifts. But then her grid of apps looks like one for a high school freshman struggling with math. There’s a tipping calculator. Accounting Tips and Tricks for Dummies. Pop Quiz daily puzzles. As her friends can attest, Sarah is not good with numbers, but she keeps working on it, determined to plot a course through her brain that finally gets it to make sense.\n\nHer boyfriend, Travis, enters the kitchen, wearing a tailored suit, carrying two neckties.\n\n“Hey, which one does your intuition say? I thought maybe the red, but in a trademark dispute I learned the color red makes people hungry. I’m probably overthinking this, but that sort of comes with the job.”\n\nSarah tears her eyes away from the footage to glance at the two ties.\n\n“The green. But you don’t need color theory to sway the jury when you have the truth.”\n\nThey briefly kiss, and Travis starts to put on the green necktie. “I adore you. That’s sweet. But in this case, just a little misguided. Image is everything with these people.”\n\nHe notices the news footage on Sarah’s laptop. “What are you watching?”\n\nSarah returns her attention to the screen. She answers vaguely, “News.”\n\n“New Mexico? Is this national?”\n\n“Found it on YouTube.”\n\n“Pipeline explosion? You know anyone involved?”\n\n“… Sort of.”\n\nTravis shakes his head and grins. “I still love your mysterious answers. See you tonight.”\n\nShe smiles brightly and waves farewell to him, but that smile vanishes the moment she looks back at the news coverage.\n\n* * *\n\nUnder a breezy midafternoon sky, Sarah sings along in her Mini Cooper to Sondheim, trying to distract herself from thoughts of the incident in New Mexico this morning. The first chorus to “I Know Things Now” is interrupted by an incoming call. On the display of her phone in its roost, the name reads UGH MOM.\n\nSarah takes a deep breath and then answers.\n\n“Hey, Mom.”\n\n“Hey yourself. Did you hear the news?”\n\nSarah tenses. “What news?”\n\n“The president has been replaced by a double.”\n\nSarah relaxes; this isn’t about New Mexico, of course it isn’t. With a practiced patience she replies, “No, Mom, that is on literally none of the news channels.”\n\n“That’s because they don’t want you to know. But there’s photo evidence. I’ll send it to you.”\n\n“Don’t—don’t send it to me, Mom.”\n\n“It’s the nose and the ears, you can compare for yourself.”\n\n“Well, whoever it is, he’s doing a fine job.”\n\n“How do you know? Don’t mock me—you’re mocking me again.”\n\n“Nothing has changed, has it? He’s not pardoning criminals or firing off nukes or whatever.”\n\n“That’s what makes me so nervous! What are they hiding?”\n\n“Tell me again what you promised me, Mom.”\n\nSarah’s mother clicks her tongue. “You really are a cop sometimes, you know.”\n\n“Okay, sure. Tell me again.”\n\n“I’m not donating money to anyone online.”\n\n“And?”\n\n“I’m not investing in silver, either. Even if it’s clearly the smarter bet these days.”\n\nSarah lets out another breath. “I love you, Mom.”\n\n“You got a funny way of showing it sometimes, Curly.”\n\n“Yeah. Probably.” She wants to say, No, you have a funny way of showing it to me, all my life, and now I am this mess of a woman driving around like I have the answers. Instead, to fill the space before it lingered, she adds, “I used to want you to love me back more than anything, but now I just want you to trust me.”\n\nHer mom lets out a breath not unlike the one Sarah did at the start of the call. “There’s a full moon tonight. Just keep that in mind for your business.”\n\n“I’m hanging up now.”\n\nSarah parks in front of a medical-business complex a dozen blocks from the Third Street Promenade.\n\nThe structure is two stories tall, in muted earth tones and a stone walkway to the open-air lobby space.\n\nSarah approaches a ground-floor office. A placard hangs near the office door displaying the business name in a clean, beveled typeface. CARDEA HYPNO-REGRESSION THERAPY. A smaller placard showcases the primary clientele for this business with its union support: SAG-AFTRA, with the comedy/drama theater masks.\n\nStanding by the door right now are two uniformed Santa Monica police officers. Talking quietly to each other.\n\nSarah slows her approach. Troubled.\n\n“What is this about?”\n\nThe taller officer sizes her up. “Are you Ms. Newcomb?”\n\n“Dr. Newcomb. What brings you here?”\n\nThe shorter officer gestures at her door. “Talk to the man inside.”\n\nHe opens the door for her and Sarah enters.\n\n* * *\n\nGrant leans against the Cardea reception desk, in mid-conversation with Tahlia, the young executive assistant, at her station.\n\nTahlia crosses her arms, giving no quarter to this stranger. “Then I’ll call you when she does show up, but until then— Oh, here.”\n\n“Tahlia, what’s going on?”\n\nGrant turns his attention to Sarah. “Dr. Newcomb?”\n\nTahlia points at Grant as she addresses her boss. “This dude is with Homeland Security. I said he needs to come back with a warrant.”\n\nGrant nods. “That makes this a lot louder, but I can do that.”\n\nSarah puts her valise down on a chair. “Why would you need that?”\n\n“I won’t if you’ll answer some questions for me.”\n\nTahlia butts in with “You don’t have to do it.”\n\n“I know my rights, Tahlia.” Then, to Grant: “Tell the local cops to leave and we’ll talk in my office. But I won’t have them scaring off my clients.”\n\n“… Fair enough.”\n\nGrant makes a small gesture at the cops, who’ve been eavesdropping at the door. They nod back and walk away.\n\nGrant then points at an interior door. “This your office over here?”\n\nHe’s already walking for it. Sarah and Tahlia exchange looks that ask each other the same thing: What the heck is this? Sarah follows Grant inside.\n\n* * *\n\nSarah’s office has the kind of designed coziness you’d find as a thumbnail image for a YouTube music channel of soft rain sounds and ambient score. Heavy curtains muffle the atmosphere and traffic noise of the outside world. The furnishings are positioned in a welcoming arrangement, and nothing has sharp corners or hard cushions. A gentle, aromatic scent tickles the back of the skull. None of the chaotic mess of papers from Sarah’s home is here. This space is clean, tidy, and relaxing.\n\nGrant tours the room as Sarah settles in at her oak desk.\n\nHis silence makes her grow impatient. “So. I’m guessing you’re not here for therapy?”\n\n“How long have you had your practice?”\n\n“Five years.”\n\n“Do you like what you do?”\n\n“Agent—I’m sorry, what’s your name?”\n\n“Lukather. Grant Lukather.”\n\n“Is this interview for a newsletter or something? Or are you on a case?”\n\nGrant settles into the chair opposite her desk.\n\n“I’m here about the call you made two days ago to Rio Rancho Police in New Mexico.”\n\nA breath of silence passes. Then Sarah speaks.\n\n“You think I made a call to New Mexico?”\n\nGrant blinks at her. “Well. Yes. You first called the hotline, and when you said it was an emergency, you were transferred to the nine-one-one line, which captures all incoming numbers.”\n\nSarah’s cheeks flush with this dawning realization. “Maybe there’s a glitch in your system? I’ve never been to New Mexico. I don’t know anyone who lives there.”\n\nGrant stares at her, aware of at least two tells that she’s lying to him. Aware that most people first think of lying when a federal agent questions them, regardless of their innocence, purely out of some lizard-brain fear mechanism. He remembers the study he read on it.\n\nHe holds up his phone and plays out a recording on speaker:\n\n“There will be an explosion.”\n\nThe 911 operator’s voice crackles back, “Did you say an explosion?”\n\n“Tomorrow morning. On the edge of town, the Manover pipeline. It will kill seven people.”\n\nGrant presses a button and pauses the recording.\n\nSarah looks from the phone to Grant. It’s clearly her voice. He waits eagerly for her next move. Sarah leans forward, resting her chin on her palms. After the kind of silence typically witnessed in a chess match, she replies.\n\n“Okay. Let’s say I made the call. Where is this going?”\n\n“Well, it’s one of two scenarios.”\n\n“Tell me.”\n\n“Either it’s some bizarre coincidence, or you’re connected to the crime.”\n\n“I’m sorry—crime?”\n\n“Foreknowledge would make it a planned act, yes. Some would even use the T-word. Terrorism.” Sarah flinches at his mention of that word. Her rattled nerves register like sirens. Grant goes on, “And a call like that, maybe it’s a collaborator who got cold feet at the last minute. Or a whistleblower who wanted to remain anonymous.”\n\nSarah opens her mouth to speak, but she stops herself from commenting, instead wringing her hands together with whitened knuckles, so he continues.\n\n“Right now, a team is scouring the site for evidence of a bomb. It seems it was an accident, but your call would suggest otherwise.”\n\nShe peeks up at him and finally replies, “Would it?”\n\n“Coincidence doesn’t give you such a specific number of victims and an accurate window of time.”\n\nGrant plucks a piece of wrapped candy from a bowl on Sarah’s desk and meticulously peels away the wrapper. “So. That leaves the other scenario.”\n\nSarah leans back in her chair, trying to reclaim her composure. “I’m curious why there isn’t a third option.”\n\n“What option would that be?” Grant asks, genuinely curious.\n\nSarah blinks at him, a bit offended he hasn’t considered it. “Well. That some people could see the future.”\n\nGrant nods and gestures—of course, right. “Everyone loves that option. It saves them from the reality of dealing with option two. How did you learn about the pipeline explosion?”\n\nShe studies Grant. Starts to say something, then stops herself. Eventually she shrugs. “I can’t tell you.”\n\n“You should. This is easy mode. I come back with a warrant, everything gets harder for you.”\n\n“I know. But I can’t speak to it.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“It would be violating client privilege. It’s a unique situation.”\n\n“Is your client from New Mexico?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“They work at the pipeline?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“They know any of the seven victims?”\n\n“No again. Look, this isn’t what you think it is. What happened was an accident. You won’t find any evidence of a bomb. But my client knew it would happen. If you can’t accept that, I can’t help you.”\n\nGrant puts the hard candy in his mouth and stares intently at Sarah. He can tell she’s tensed up, almost trembling from this encounter. But none of her other body language suggests she’s outright lying to him. In fact, this seems to be the first declaration she’s made with complete earnestness.\n\nThey sit across from each other in this standoff for a few seconds. Then Grant gets up.\n\n“Okay,” he says definitively.\n\n“Okay what?”\n\n“I’ll be back with a warrant.” Grant heads out the door, closing it behind him.\n\nNot five seconds later, Tahlia steps inside, peering back to make sure Grant has fully left their office. “What a dick, right? You want me to call Travis for you? I bet he could get the dirt on this guy’s case.”\n\nSarah picks up her office phone and starts to dial. “No. I need to see Marigold.”",

      "content": "2. The Client and the Metronome\n\nTHE CLIENT AND THE METRONOME\n\nTahlia can’t let it go, particularly because the man was as rude with her as he was handsome, which makes her even more upset. At her reception desk, she does some online research and learns the following: The specific agency Special Agent Lukather hails from is called Predictive Analytics. It was founded shortly after the attacks on September 11 to investigate any individual who publicly predicted the towers would fall in New York. Their mission is not to find actual oracles or prophets—a government agency wouldn’t believe in those things—but rather to investigate if anyone who accurately predicted an event that led to American casualties was somehow involved in the planning of the event.\n\nTahlia can’t find specific information about its agents. She does a search for Grant Lukather, but without more specific information, the internet isn’t much help.\n\nShe clicks through news searches and image searches to see if any photos of Grant appear. She finds one of him from six years ago, where he has cropped hair and a confident smile. He nearly looks like a different person, here. And in an FBI Academy uniform. So he moved over to Predictive Analytics at some point.\n\nThe other photo that shows up multiple times is a house. Burned to its foundation. Only a back wall and the fireplace remain standing. The lawn in all directions has been scorched to black char. In the background, nothing but the devastation of a wildfire.\n\nTahlia clicks through to find an article about the wildfire ravaging a small town, destroying nearly four hundred homes and killing seventy-one people. Grant is named among those homeowners whose house was affected by the damage.\n\nThis is the article she’s reading when Marigold Chu arrives at the office.\n\n* * *\n\nGrant drives to the Santa Monica Courthouse, only a handful of blocks from the beach. The smell of the ocean fills his nostrils as he ascends the steps.\n\nThe process is one Grant has learned by rote. Although it varies slightly from state to state, gaining a warrant for a basic workplace search has little resistance in the justice system, particularly when the one making the request is from Homeland Security. In many respects, the paranoia born from terrorist attacks more than twenty years ago has allowed law enforcement to gain a dangerous amount of power. The longest it has taken Grant to secure a search warrant is eight hours, and that was from a judge in Tennessee who had a bias against federal agencies and made Grant jump through a number of hoops before signing it. But if the judge hadn’t authorized the warrant, Grant could simply have gone over his head and called in for a higher-ranking official to approve it. It would’ve made the local cops helping Grant on the case more difficult as partners, but it wouldn’t have stopped him.\n\nIn Grant’s experience, how local law enforcement handles search warrants is a flag to their behavior in the community, for good or ill. When a judge demands more information, requires more paperwork to document the warrant, and follows up with calls to Grant’s boss, Omar, then Grant oddly feels better about the local authority, and the process in general. Perhaps they’d gotten in trouble handing out too many sketchy warrants to bullies in uniform eager to kick down someone’s door and seize their belongings. A judge who issues no-knock warrants is even more suspicious to Grant. But people who question the request and verify Grant’s credentials—they’re at least paying attention to the law.\n\nThis time, Grant meets with a sleepy-eyed judge who seems more curious about the scope of the Predictive Analytics Agency than the specifics of Grant’s current case, but she signs the document and sends him along.\n\nThe whole process takes two hours.\n\n* * *\n\nSarah’s office door swings open and Grant barges in, with Tahlia in pursuit, barking at him, “You can’t go in there!”\n\nSarah blinks in surprise. “Agent.”\n\n“I kept my word.” Grant holds up a warrant, freshly signed by LA County Judge Nancy Coleman.\n\nFrom the door, a flustered Tahlia says to Sarah over Grant’s tall frame, “I told him he couldn’t go in!”\n\n“A judge says otherwise.”\n\nSarah clears her throat, clearly disapproving. “I’m with a client.”\n\nGrant looks over for the first time to see Marigold on the couch. Staring at him.\n\nMarigold is a Chinese American woman in her late thirties, dressed in modest clothing but wearing a stylish pair of glasses. This is her first experience with a therapist, having grown up in a family that looked down upon any form of mental health care. Her mother called it a scam invented by Western insurance companies. Her father told her therapy is the coward’s search for someone else to blame for their own problems. Marigold’s parents divorced a week after she left for college, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nIt’s only her fifth session with Sarah, so she hasn’t opened up much about her family yet. She frowns at Grant. “I take it this is the federal agent you mentioned.”\n\nGrant gestures at Marigold as he looks to Sarah. “Who is this?”\n\nBut Sarah pushes him back out of the office and into the waiting room: “Nooope, nope nope, out you go.” She follows, shutting the door behind her with a brief, polite smile to Marigold. “Be right back, sorry.”\n\nGrant crosses his arms. “Are we going to have a legitimate interview now?”\n\nSarah narrows her eyes at Grant, dubious. “Maybe. But first—Tahlia, check and make sure this is a legitimate warrant. Call the clerk’s office for that judge.”\n\nTahlia takes the paper with all the speed and precision of a short-order cook during a lunch rush. “On it!”\n\nSarah guides Grant to the opposite corner of the reception area, farthest from Tahlia’s desk. “If you’re serious about this, then you need to be serious about my rules.”\n\n“I would think the rule of law supersedes yours.”\n\n“Not when it comes to my commitment to my client. That includes her privacy. Do you understand the basic principles of therapy?”\n\nFeeling like she’s shaming him, Grant scoffs, “Do you understand the basics of a homicide investigation?”\n\nSarah blinks. “Honestly, only what I’ve seen on cop shows, and I wouldn’t think they’re steeped in realism, you know? I have more respect for your profession than that.”\n\nThis vexes Grant, who’s still mystified by Sarah’s role in his case. He rakes a hand through his hair and starts again. “Listen. If your client is implicated in this, even with some claim she predicted it would happen, then I need access to her.”\n\n“I would be neglecting my responsibility for her under my care to just let you interrogate her at my office.”\n\n“I can bring her outside, or across the street to a café, but it has to happen now.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because she can’t be in your office right now by coincidence. She didn’t have a scheduled appointment today, did she? You must have called her in.” Grant catches Sarah looking away in an obvious Oh, shit expression, which she does a terrible job of covering. “Which means you could be training her on what to say or not to say to me. You could be conspiring against me, for all I know.”\n\nSarah’s eyes widen in shock—and somehow, Grant believes it’s genuine. She finds her words and replies, “How dare you. Talking about me like some sort of Mafia boss—I was only alerting her to the fact you showed up asking about a discovery from our last session.”\n\nTahlia steps close, holding the warrant out to Sarah. “It’s legit.”\n\nGrant tilts his head—See?\n\nBut then Tahlia continues, “However, it doesn’t allow him access to your confidential client files. No data or recordings of sessions, none of that.”\n\nSarah tilts her head back at him—Oh ho?\n\n“I can lawfully obtain a list of your clients and reach out to each one of them directly, though. I can do that. Whether they choose to talk to me is another story, maybe even another warrant. But I’m here now, and so is the person I’d like to meet. So.”\n\nHe stares at Sarah. Waiting her out.\n\nTahlia steps behind Sarah and stares back, to give off two-versus-one vibes.\n\nSarah considers this for a moment.\n\n“Some ground rules first,” she says with calm authority.\n\nGrant stops himself from snapping back, to see what conditions she offers.\n\nSarah counts out on her fingers as she goes:\n\n“First, she doesn’t have to reveal any part of her therapy that makes her uncomfortable. That could be her symptoms, her trauma, or any of the treatment we’ve been trying.” Grant doesn’t stop her, so Sarah extends another finger. “Second, your interview with Marigold must be limited to questions she can reasonably answer about herself. We will not be discussing any other clients of mine with her.”\n\n“I don’t know who else you have as clients, at least not yet, so how would I know?”\n\n“You simply keep your line of questioning focused on her, not me or anyone else.”\n\nGrant rubs his chin, then nods in acquiescence.\n\n“Three, you must get her verbal consent—and mine—to take part in a therapy session today. I’m not approving that yet, not until we hear from her first.”\n\n“Why do you think I’d ask to sit in?”\n\n“Because you’re going to.”\n\n“Is that a bit of predictive analytics on your part?” Grant raises an eyebrow at Sarah.\n\nShe blinks, taking him too seriously. “What? No. It’s intuition. So, are we clear?”\n\n* * *\n\nSarah steps back into her office with Grant in tow. Tahlia closes the door behind them for privacy.\n\nMarigold looks from Sarah to Grant. Before they can speak, she starts with “This really is about me, somehow, isn’t it?”\n\nSarah takes a breath before starting in. “Yes. As I was saying before we were interrupted, Agent Lukather here is working on a case, and he has reason to believe it relates to your condition.”\n\nMarigold leans back into the couch. “All right. I’m curious. How?”\n\nGrant’s attention keeps shifting from Sarah to Marigold. He interrupts, “Could you elaborate on what your condition is, first?”\n\nSarah immediately steps just slightly in front of Grant, to establish for Marigold that Sarah’s word is stronger than his.\n\n“You don’t have to share anything with him. You are fully protected by California law under therapist-patient privilege and Evidence Code 1014. Whatever warrant this agent has, it doesn’t extend to your private testimony.”\n\nGrant sours at the specific mention of legal statutes—clearly Sarah had begun prepping for his return. He adds, “The warrant is just an opening move, by the way.”\n\nSarah keeps her attention on Marigold as if her client were the most important person in the building. “That said—and I hate to admit this—he may help us shed some light on what’s happening to you.”\n\nGrant continues with “I can bring you both in for questioning as persons of interest—”\n\nBut Sarah holds up a shush gesture at Grant, keeping her focus on her client.\n\nMarigold looks down at her hands, toying with her Oura ring. She takes a breath. “I’m here because I want to get better. I need to get better. If there’s a connection to someone else’s case, then maybe talking about it helps us both.”\n\nSarah turns to face Grant. Awaiting his reaction.\n\nGrant drops the harsh federal-agent tone immediately with Marigold. He slowly sits down in a chair facing the couch. Gently: “Thank you, Marigold. This makes it easier on all of us.”\n\n“Hang on,” Sarah says with a fresh assertive tone. “Now that we’re all in the same room, let me cover this once more: She doesn’t answer any questions that make her feel uncomfortable here. If you require another interview with her, it won’t be done in my office, and it will be with her lawyer present the entire time. Do we understand each other?”\n\nGrant nods first at Sarah, and then at Marigold. He waits until Sarah is fully settled in her therapist’s chair to ask his first question.\n\n“What brought you to Dr. Newcomb?”\n\n“Missing time.”\n\nGrant pulls out his little notebook and readies his pen.\n\n“I started blacking out, losing a few minutes here and there. Always with a cluster headache to follow. And it extended into trouble sleeping.”\n\nMarigold stares down at her hands again before muttering, “But most of all is this feeling.”\n\nGrant gently coaxes, “A feeling?”\n\n“I can’t describe it other than a sensation that—that something is fundamentally broken. Like I’ve lost track of something vital, like my car keys or glasses. Except everything is accounted for in my life.”\n\n“Did you seek medical treatment first? Like a doctor, or a neurologist?”\n\nMarigold sighs. “I burned through a lot of my health coverage with those visits, yeah. They found nothing. So I was recommended therapy.”\n\n“And how is Dr. Newcomb treating you?”\n\nMarigold pauses again, glancing at Sarah.\n\nSarah gives a warm smile and a nod of approval. So Marigold continues.\n\n“Well, I’ve never had hypnotic-regression therapy before. But her sessions have helped my symptoms. I’m usually good for a few days after coming here. I know I need more work, but it’s progress. I just wish I remembered more than vague images.”\n\n“We’ll get there,” Sarah encourages.\n\nMarigold nods.\n\nSarah asks, “Have you kept a journal at your bedside like I asked? To write down your dreams first thing in the morning?”\n\n“I’m still trying to make that a habit. I’m so groggy when I wake up, I just…” Marigold seems to rediscover Grant sitting in the room with them, and it jolts her out of her talk with Sarah. She asks him directly, “So, what does this have to do with your case, Agent?”\n\nGrant sits back in the chair. “I don’t know yet. Have you been to or know anyone from New Mexico? Near Albuquerque?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“What do you do for a living?”\n\n“I’m a programmer.”\n\n“Have you ever worked for a pipeline company?”\n\n“What? No.” Marigold looks to Sarah. “What are these questions?”\n\n“I think it will be better if we wait until after I have a session with you before we continue this with Agent Lukather.”\n\nGrant’s posture stiffens. “I need to be present for this.”\n\n“Absolutely not,” Sarah says flatly.\n\n“Then explain to me how your private session is helpful to my case, and not obstruction.”\n\n“My patient’s subconscious is not part of your warrant.”\n\n“What, is the answer to the Manover pipeline incident in her dreams?”\n\nMarigold crooks her head. “Manover?” But Sarah and Grant don’t hear her.\n\nSarah’s voice rises. “I’m not setting a dangerous precedent against the one law that makes therapy safe from predatory government, you understand?”\n\n“You’re the one who put Marigold in the crosshairs!”\n\nMarigold stands up suddenly. “Okay! Okay. One session. Agent, you can sit in. But if it turns out I’m not relevant to whatever you’re investigating in New Mexico, you have to take your warrant and leave us both alone.”\n\nTense silence fills the room as Grant considers his options.\n\nEventually, he nods. The women look visibly relieved.\n\n“What now?” Grant asks.\n\n* * *\n\nAn electric metronome pulses with a soft light, perched on the table in front of Sarah’s sofa. The light is accompanied by a sound that’s a combination of a short breath and a low, resonant tone that reaches the inner ear. It’s both tranquil and unsettling. A steady, perfectly timed thum sound.\n\nMarigold now lies on the couch, her head turned to see the metronome. To stare at it as Sarah speaks gently to her.\n\nGrant has been repositioned to sit at the far corner of the room, out of Marigold’s direct line of sight. He rolls his pen between his thumb and pointer finger, hovering it over his weathered notebook.\n\nSarah’s voice takes on a glassy quality. “I’m going to count down from ten. As I do, you’ll become relaxed, more and more, until you find yourself in a deep, restful sleep. Ten. Nine.”\n\nThum. Thum.\n\nMarigold’s eyelids get heavy.\n\n“The rest of the world is pushed aside for now. It’s only you, and the sound of my voice. Eight. Seven.”\n\nThum. Thum.\n\nMarigold closes her eyes.\n\nThe metronome pulses softly.\n\n“Feel your body release all tension. Starting at your feet. And traveling up your legs, and your back, to your neck. Let it out in a breath. Six. Five.”\n\nMarigold sighs.\n\nHer body seems to sink a fraction into the sofa, as her muscles unclench.\n\nThe metronome sound begins to grow louder. Larger.\n\nThe device even seems larger. Or the room has shrunk.\n\n“As you drift into a peaceful trance, you feel that ribbon around your waist. Four. Three.”\n\nMarigold’s eyes remain closed.\n\nIn her world, the thum is like the heartbeat of a whale. And Sarah speaks to her as an ethereal spirit from another dimension.\n\nA silk ribbon is tied to her waist. Taut. Leading straight up.\n\nNearby, the metronome is a tower. Sarah’s office is gone. Instead, Marigold lies supine in a cavernous room with no sense of walls or ceiling.\n\nThummmm. Thummmm.\n\nEchoing in this space, like the sound of a goddess, Sarah’s voice continues, “This binds you to the conscious world. But you are free. Two. One. Pull it loose.”\n\nMarigold opens her eyes and pulls at the knot.\n\nThe red ribbon yanks away as if it were tied to a balloon high above, in the dark.\n\nAs it goes, the metronome tower goes with it, leaving Marigold in a void. Just empty space.\n\nBarely lit by the steady cold-white pulse of light from the unseen metronome, Marigold finds herself drifting in zero gravity. Sarah’s voice resonates from the ether like a ghostly guide.\n\n“Now you approach a light. The light is a portal. When you pass through it, you return to your previous life. The person you were before you were born as Marigold.”\n\nA light blooms behind Marigold. She turns to face it, to bask in it, then starts to swim toward it.\n\nUnnoticed by her, a new ribbon lashes out from the light, a tendril of an unseen creature, and loops around Marigold’s waist, pulling her in.\n\n* * *\n\nGrant stops taking notes and looks toward Sarah and her client.\n\nHe turns his attention to Sarah’s bookshelf and gives it a closer inspection. Many Lives, Many Masters sits prominently on the shelf, alongside hypnotherapy books.\n\nSo she’s a quack, Grant thinks. His posture changes. Sarah notices but quickly returns her attention to Marigold on the couch.\n\nGrant clears his throat.\n\nSarah looks back at him again. And sees Grant shaking his head at her. He mouths the words but doesn’t speak them out loud: This is bogus.\n\nSarah holds up a finger: Wait for it. Like she expected this reaction from Grant. In that same glassy, low voice, she says to Marigold, “You have returned to the last days of your previous life. Are you there?”\n\n* * *\n\nMarigold opens her eyes and blinks against a bright light that occludes her vision. She can feel she’s still lying down like she was on Sarah’s couch, but the world feels different to her; colder. Something tickles her nose, but as she reaches to scratch it, her hand is restrained by an unseen force that binds it.\n\nThe fog lifts and the light recedes, and Marigold discovers she’s lying in a hospital bed with an oxygen tube taped to her nostrils. An intravenous line runs from a hanging saline bag to her left hand, the needle taped to her wrist. It’s harder to swallow, harder to breathe, difficult to move her head and look around to get her bearings. When she speaks, her voice is coarse and raspy. Like she is decades older here.\n\n“I’m there.”\n\nFrom the other end of a tunnel, Sarah’s voice reaches her, reverberating like an echo before the words become clear. “Who are you? And where are you?”\n\nMarigold slowly sits up and stares across the room, finding a mirror opposite the bed.\n\nIn the reflection, she sees a man who looks gray-haired and tired enough to be in his seventies, with salt-and-pepper hair.\n\nAnd like that, Marigold is gone. This older man is now the one in the room.\n\n“My name is Brian Huntley. I’m sixty-eight. Dying of lung cancer.” He looks around. “In a nursing home in Denver. My hometown.”\n\nThe ghostly voice of Sarah whispers, “What is the date?”\n\n“Thursday. I think.”\n\n“The full date, Brian.”\n\nBrian turns his head to see a wall clock. But this one looks far more high-tech than it should. Especially in a lower-income nursing home. Even the medical gear in the room seems futuristic.\n\nThe full date cycles through on the wall clock and Brian reads it aloud.\n\n“August twenty-second, 2057.”",

      "content": "3. The Past Is the Future\n\nTHE PAST IS THE FUTURE\n\nSarah looks to Grant, gesturing as if to say, Well?\n\nGrant sits up. Caught completely off guard. He blurts out. “What?”\n\nBut Sarah shushes him. She returns her attention to Marigold. “Brian, can you hear me?”\n\nMarigold speaks, but in that raw, cracked voice of Brian’s. Like she’s possessed by another spirit. “Yes.”\n\n“We are going to travel to another day in your life, Brian. All right? I want you to rewind. Go back to the night of October eighteenth, 2023.”\n\nGrant checks his phone. That is today’s date.\n\n* * *\n\nThe nursing home is gone. Brian Huntley sits in a recliner in the living room of a mid-century single-story house, decorated with some fake cobwebs and a dangling skeleton over the kitchen counter behind him. The light and sound of a large flat-screen TV washes over him, his attention transfixed by whatever he’s watching.\n\nHe takes a sip of a bottle of beer and says to no one, “I’m there.”\n\nDistantly, like a voice from the other room competing with the TV, Sarah calls to him.\n\n“Where are you? What are you doing?”\n\nBrian gestures like it’s plain to see. “I’m watching the game. Kings versus Warriors. I don’t have skin in it, but my partner on the force is from San Fran, and I wanna know what mood he’ll be in tomorrow.”\n\n* * *\n\nGrant is on the edge of his seat.\n\nSarah leans in closer to Marigold. “Good. This is good. Brian, listen to me. I want you to tell me the final score of this game.”\n\nMarigold’s brow furrows. She twitches slightly.\n\nIn that same low, masculine voice, she replies, “It’s fourth quarter.”\n\n“Move ahead just a little.”\n\n“Kings are up by two in the final seconds. If they pull this off, Allen will be pissed all day. Oh, wait, wait, Curry has it—he sinks it for three.”\n\n“What is the final score, Brian?”\n\n“One sixteen to one fifteen, Warriors win. Allen might even bring doughnuts tomorrow. This is good news for the whole bullpen.”\n\nAfter this declaration Sarah turns to look pointedly at Grant.\n\nGrant rolls his eyes.\n\nShe points at his notebook and mimes, Write it down.\n\nGrant shakes his head in disbelief. But he writes down the score of the basketball game nonetheless. As he does, he listens to Sarah complete her session with Marigold.\n\n“All right. Time to return to Marigold. Back through the light. Follow the sound of my voice.”\n\nBut Grant sees his writing hand start to shake from the absurdity of the situation, and that he clearly got carried away by it. For a moment, he nearly believed.\n\n* * *\n\nMarigold shakes hands with both Sarah and Grant, at the threshold of the office.\n\n“I hope I was useful. I’m feeling a little better, as always.”\n\n“You were great.” Sarah beams.\n\nGrant frowns, probing, “What do you remember from the session?”\n\n“Very little. I was a man. I have the taste of beer in the back of my mouth, now. And my fingers smell like cigarettes.”\n\nGrant grins. “To you, you mean?”\n\nShe offers her hand to Grant, who sniffs her fingers as respectfully as he can.\n\nHe pulls back, alarmed. Clearly, he smelled smoke. “Do you smoke?”\n\n“Never. I had asthma when I was young.” Then, she adds, to try to comfort Grant, “This experience is so surreal, isn’t it? But weirdly life-affirming.”\n\nGrant is momentarily at a loss for words. Sarah basks for a moment in triumph at breaking the brain of such a staunch disbeliever. She touches Marigold comfortingly. “You start that dream journal, okay?”\n\nMarigold keeps her attention on Grant. “Was I any help to you?”\n\nGrant is miles away for a moment, but pulls himself back to try to find an answer.\n\n“I don’t yet know. I may need to reach out to you later, if that’s all right.”\n\n“Sure.” And Marigold starts to walk away, but stops to add, “Honestly, it’s weirdly comforting to know the federal government believes in past lives.”\n\nShe leaves before Grant can stammer out a rebuttal.\n\nSarah leans against her office door and faces Grant, her eyes bright with excitement. “And?”\n\n“And what?”\n\n“Still a scam?”\n\n“Of course.”\n\nSarah blinks. Not the answer she was expecting. She sighs, then returns to her desk and writes something down.\n\n“Of course. Still stubborn. I get it.”\n\nShe tears off the memo slip and hands it to Grant. “This is a diner nearby. It serves good coffee and a mean breakfast sandwich. Nine tomorrow morning good?”\n\n“Good for what?”\n\n“For you to admit you were wrong.”\n\nGrant’s gaze travels from the note to Sarah’s smile.\n\n* * *\n\nOmar Johnson attempts the card trick again.\n\nOnce more, his fingers fumble with the eight of spades during the transfer to the other hand, where he’s supposed to slide it into another stack at the bottom. He reshuffles, consults the magic book on his desk once more, pauses a video on his phone showing the position of a magician’s hands with a deck of cards, and goes again.\n\nThis time, he makes a smooth transition of the proper card, but in the snap-and-flip move at the end to reveal the chosen card, Omar manages to successfully display the five of diamonds.\n\n“Where did my eight go? Come on, man.”\n\nIn the office around him, other props and artifacts of stage magic crowd the bookcases and tabletops. A Hoyle deck under a glass case sits in a shelf spotlight. A trio of chrome juggling rings, interlocked, dangle from a wall. Two antique theater posters advertising a magic duo known as the Fang Brothers adorn another wall.\n\nWith the exception of a small framed photo of Omar with his wife and daughter on vacation at some ski lodge, smiling and bundled up, every other framed photo in the office showcases Omar in a private-security uniform posing with men holding cards. Ricky Jay. Derek DelGaudio. Shin Lim. Penn and Teller.\n\nOmar is fascinated with how a trick works. It’s the art of deception. And the more he understands about deception, the better he is at catching criminals in his line of work.\n\nLine two on his office phone chirps and an LED screen displays the caller’s name. Omar picks up the handset and leans back in his chair.\n\n“Grant. Give me some news. You’ve been radio silent ever since I put you on the pipeline case, and it’s making me nervous.”\n\nGrant breathes through his nose loudly before responding. “This one is strange, boss. Very strange.”\n\n“How so? Was it a bomb?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“What else could it be? She predicted it would happen, it happened. So?”\n\n“Yeah…”\n\nOmar overhears a TV from somewhere near Grant, and the sounds of a basketball game encroach on the conversation—the squeaking of athletic shoes on the court, the cheering, and the broadcaster’s voice.\n\n“And he’s chomping at the bit for another try,” says the TV.\n\n“It’s champing at the bit,” corrects Grant.\n\n“You’re talking to the TV again, Grant. Did forensics get back to you with their analysis of the pipeline rupture?”\n\n“They did. No evidence of an explosive device. Seems it was a buildup due to a malfunction in their system. Hang on—why are you still at the office? It’s late there.”\n\nOmar stares out at the larger office floor that’s home to Predictive Analytics: a grid of beige cubicles bordered by beige offices with glass walls. And then there is Omar’s oasis of magic. His office more resembles a gift shop at a theme park.\n\n“The in-laws are staying over this week, so I’m hiding out. Back to you. Is it sabotage?”\n\n“I mean, maybe. But for what purpose? To what end?”\n\n“We call it an act of terror because all it needs to do is terrify people. There’s your end.”\n\nBut Grant has thought this through. “Those examples come soon after with a foreigner claiming victory in a bunker on a YouTube video, or a lone white man’s handwritten manifesto in a spiral notebook. I don’t have any of that out here.”\n\nOmar shuffles his cards, cradling the handset between his shoulder and ear. “What do you have?”\n\n“A five-foot-three past-life therapist who smells lovely.”\n\n“What’s her deal?”\n\nGrant sighs. “I don’t know if it’s her. Or if it’s just her. She brought in a client.”\n\n“So maybe it’s the client?”\n\n“Maybe. Once I figure out the motive, the other cards will fall into place.”\n\nOmar finishes shuffling and turns over the first four cards face up.\n\nThey’re all aces.\n\nOmar grins to himself. “I’m sure they will,” he mutters.\n\n“What?”\n\n“Do you know how many oracles, psychics, doomsayers, and mediums we’ve interviewed since the start of this department, Grant?”\n\n“A lot.”\n\n“A lot. Yes. More than a thousand. And how many of those cases have ever been resolved definitively as psychic phenomenon?”\n\n“Are we ignoring the inconclusive ones?”\n\n“Don’t play semantics with me now, come on.”\n\n“Zero cases, boss.”\n\n“It was the same when I worked security at Caesars Palace. Everyone wants to believe in the supernatural, the magic formula, or the lucky rabbit’s foot, but they’re either hiding a con, or they’ve been duped by one. Anyway, this therapist. If you can’t find the why, go back and look for the how. One will lead to the other.”\n\n“I know the job, Omar.”\n\n“I know you know. Sometimes you have to hear it from your superiors. Like, what do I always say?”\n\n“Find the trick.”\n\nIn unison, the two men say flatly, as a mantra, “There’s always a trick.”\n\n* * *\n\nGrant stares at the TV in his Santa Monica hotel room as the final seconds of the NBA preseason game play out. He was never a basketball fan, but his high school friends played enough for him to know the sport. Now, tonight, he finds himself utterly riveted to the screen, watching the score tilt from what had clearly been a win for the Kings into a nail-biter with ten seconds left on the clock.\n\nThe Kings are currently leading 115–113. But a player has just passed the ball to Steph Curry for the Warriors at the backcourt.\n\n“Steph has it,” the broadcaster says, anticipation rising. “Eight seconds.”\n\nSteph Curry springs off his feet and catapults the ball with both hands from outside the three-point line.\n\nThe ball arcs perfectly into the basket. Nothing but net.\n\n“He hits it with five point five on the clock! The Kings are out of time-outs!” The crowd is on its feet with a surge of cheering, clapping, and screaming.\n\nGrant is on his feet, too. Still staring at the TV, gobsmacked.\n\nThe final seconds of the game play out with a desperate attempt from a Kings player to sink his own three-pointer. But it goes wide.\n\nThe Warriors win. Precisely as Marigold predicted.\n\nAfter a breathless silence, Grant speaks aloud, to no one in particular, “What the hell is going on?”",

Travis, seated beside her, is focused on the national news on TV, but Sarah has her attention on her phone, listening via earbuds.\n\nShe squeals in excitement at the score, startling Travis.\n\n“What? What?”\n\n“Sorry, sorry—just watching this game.”\n\n“What game?” He leans over and looks at her phone. “Hang on. When did you start following basketball?”\n\n“Just this game.”\n\n“Why? You put money on it?” Said as a joke. But when he sees Sarah struggling to answer, he gets serious quickly. “You aren’t actually gambling, are you?”\n\n“No! Why would you think that?”\n\n“You have done wilder things in the past, is all I’m saying.”\n\nSarah frowns at Travis. “Wild? Like what?”\n\n“You drove to San Diego after you had that nightmare your college roommate was in trouble. You bought wallpaper for your office a year before you had one. That sort of thing.”\n\n“I’m intuitive.”\n\nTravis smiles at her. “It’s cute.”\n\nSarah softens. “Well, my breakfast meeting just got way more interesting.”\n\n“Sounds mysterious. Oh, hey—the DA is holding a little dinner party this weekend. We should go.” He takes a drink from his Corona. Sarah knows this behavior from him too well. Whenever he asks for something he wants, he hides behind a glass or a mouthful of food right after proposing it.\n\n“Mm. I’d love to. I haven’t met anyone from your new office yet.”\n\n“Yeah. Gives us an excuse to dress up a little.”\n\nShe kneads her toes on his leg as they sit on the couch together. Travis gently drapes one arm over her feet. But a moment later, his smile fades.\n\n“Just … when you talk to them, let’s not get too specific about the kind of therapy you do.”\n\nSarah feels her body tense slightly. As if every muscle is awaiting what comes next.\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“You know how it is. Some people just don’t understand that sort of thing.”\n\n“… Oh.”\n\nTravis doesn’t look at her. Keeps his attention on the TV.\n\nSarah considers asking him more about it, but Travis raises the volume with the remote. And it sends an unspoken signal: I’m done talking about this.\n\nAfter a moment, Sarah stands up and walks off, muttering, “I’m gonna meditate for a bit.”\n\n* * *\n\nThe next morning. Grant’s sedan and Sarah’s sporty two-door sit parked side by side outside Sunny Side Up Diner.\n\nAt a booth inside, Sarah sips her green tea and grins at a very flustered federal agent sitting opposite her. Her knee bounces excitedly under the table. She’s practically vibrating with anticipation. She makes the first move. “Have something to say?”\n\nGrant puts his notebook on the table, next to his plate of pancakes.\n\n“Three students at MIT.”\n\n“MIT?”\n\n“They got together and wrote thirty lines of code in Python. A program that used aggregate data from all NBA games of the last five years. A sequence of statistics: offensive and defensive efficiency. Possessions per game. That sort of thing. They multiplied each team’s offense with the opponent’s defense and divided by league average. And then using those answers, multiplied again and divided by one hundred to get a final score for each game.”\n\nSarah blinks at him. “This is what you researched last night?”\n\nGrant barrels on, “But the data wasn’t very accurate, so they began adding elements, like an adjustment for if it was a home game or an away game. Finally, they had a model that offered them what is called threshold accuracy. Do you know what that is?”\n\n“I’m bad at math.”\n\n“It’s when you have a tool that’s good enough at guessing an outcome that you can begin betting money on it every time and come out a winner. And for a while, those three kids at MIT won enough in sports betting to get banned from two casinos. Then one of them leaked the program online in an act of defiance or anarchy, and you had a surge in speculation betting for a month.”\n\nSarah sets her tea down and rests her chin on her hands, staring Grant directly in the eye.\n\n“So, Agent, you’re saying Marigold came up with a program to predict a basketball score and that’s what is going on here?”\n\nGrant pauses and gestures to a waitress with his coffee mug. She steers over to him and refills his drink.\n\nOnce the waitress is out of earshot, Grant answers, “That program has not been able to hit threshold accuracy for three years. Too many factors for a program to manage. Even so, a few websites still post its prediction for every game. It calculated the Kings would win last night.”\n\nSarah perks up. Her eyes brighten. “Does that mean you believe me now?”\n\nGrant coughs into his napkin and regains his composure.\n\n“Dr. Newcomb.”\n\n“Sarah. Please. You’re not a client of mine. You’re a peer.”\n\n“I’m a federal agent.”\n\n“Whatever. Do you believe this is real?”\n\n“I don’t know what to believe, at this point.”\n\n“Because you don’t want to think about it.”\n\n“Oh, I’ve been thinking about it nonstop. You used hypnotherapy to allegedly regress a woman back to her previous life, only her previous life is someone living now, in the same time as her, which is how you have been able to predict the future, through whatever you can get in a session with this other character. Do I have that right?”\n\nShe leans in closer to him, surprising Grant. “Doesn’t that blow your mind?”\n\n“Why are you so quick to buy into this? How do you explain Marigold’s condition?”\n\nSarah sits back and bites her thumbnail. “I don’t know. I’ve never encountered this before. People have come to me with things like the fear of water, I bring them back and we learn they drowned in the 1920s. That has been my therapy work. This, whatever this is—it’s new.”\n\n“Or it’s a confidence game. A scam.”\n\n“For what? And on whom?”\n\nGrant shrugs, equally lost. “Maybe Marigold will ask us to bet on a game, or some other predictive event.”\n\n“But she doesn’t remember that. You and I are the only ones who knew.”\n\n“Hang on—why haven’t you bet on a game?”\n\n“If you recall, I already tried to do something on my own with knowledge of the future and it didn’t work. Seven people still died in New Mexico.”\n\n“You learned about that from Marigold?”\n\n“Yeah. Well, technically from Brian. I regressed her to a point where Brian was watching the news and got it the same way I got the basketball game.”\n\nGrant lets out a breath and sits back. He stares at the ceiling, trying to parse it all. “It doesn’t make sense.”\n\n“I have a theory. Been working on it since my fourth session with Marigold.”\n\nGrant returns his attention to her. Waits for her to elaborate.\n\nSarah points at Grant’s notebook and pen. “May I?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\nShe opens to a blank spread of pages.\n\n“I’ve done past-life regression as therapy because it’s produced tangible results, but if I’m honest, the practice has never forced me to believe in the phenomenon as a science. Only as a form of therapy. If it helped someone get over their fears or conquer a personal trauma, then great. But if it’s real, then you have to do the math.”\n\n“What math?”\n\n“There is a finite number of souls in the universe.”\n\nGrant blinks. “What?”\n\n“For reincarnation to be possible, you can’t have a new soul created with every newborn life. There wouldn’t be any room for reincarnation, then. You have a bank. Like a total number of souls, who cycle through bodies as they’re born into this world.”\n\n“Okay…”\n\n“So let’s put a number on it. For argument’s sake, there are a billion souls.”\n\n“That seems low.”\n\n“Does it? In all the millions of years of human life, world population didn’t reach one billion until the year 1804. It was drastically smaller for most of our timeline as a people. Which means—”\n\nGrant catches up to her logic. “Which means there would be a lot of souls just waiting for the world population to catch up. Unless the population of souls also grew at a similar rate.”\n\n“Maybe. But again, we’re talking about a dynamic that would make reincarnation part of the cycle of human life. So it’s tricky. But consider this: It took us one hundred and twenty-three years to reach a world population of two billion, so we’re at the year 1927 now. How long do you think it took us to hit three billion living humans?”\n\nGrant frowns, calculating the leap to the current number in less than a century. “Hmm.”\n\n“Right. We were three billion by 1960. So that growth spurt only took thirty-three years. And then only fourteen years to hit four billion by 1974. And so on and so forth, until we’re at eight billion now.”\n\n“It’s an accelerated path, yes.”\n\n“Right. So I’m left to wonder, what if there aren’t enough souls to go around? What if the number of human souls is less? It doesn’t have to be much less. Even if it’s seven billion, that leaves another billion humans to account for. Do you think anyone is walking around without a soul, here?”\n\nGrant rubs his forehead. This mental exercise is giving him a headache. “I don’t know. I don’t typically think about the concept of a human soul, and never in such absurd numbers.”\n\nSarah starts drawing in Grant’s notebook. “The afterlife—or whatever you want to call it—is this plane of existence beyond here. Nearly every religion on the planet believes in the afterlife, and most also believe in past lives, reincarnation. So you have a kind of liminal space where souls exist between human lives.”\n\n“Heaven? Purgatory?”\n\nSarah breathes through her teeth and looks to Grant, suddenly self-conscious. “Well, I don’t want to aggravate you. I’m not proving or disproving heaven, hell, any of those places. But if we are talking about a soul returning to live again as a human after passing to the afterlife, I don’t know how a final resting place for souls works in that system.”\n\n“You don’t believe in heaven?”\n\nSarah is quick to reply, “I do! Really. Or, at the very least, I want to believe. But if reincarnation is real, then some place like heaven may be a different place than I imagined. Because if you’re good and you go to heaven, can you come back? And if not, who keeps being reincarnated here, then?”\n\nGrant drinks his coffee as he wrestles with Sarah’s questions.\n\nShe draws more in his notebook. As she does, she wags her tongue for a moment, unaware. Grant finds himself watching her facial expressions instead of the notebook, quietly amused.\n\n“Here.” She shows him her drawing.\n\n“Maybe what is starting to happen now, some of us live a full life, we die in the future, but because the afterlife—whatever you want to call it—exists outside of time and space, and because there is this imbalance since the population is so large, our soul must reenter the world back in the time it already lived, creating this weird overlap.”\n\nGrant groans. “Please. Sarah. You’re making my head hurt.”\n\n“Now you know how I’ve felt for the last month! It was enough for me to wrap my head around past lives, but this? This is simultaneous lives.”\n\n“Sarah. My job isn’t to prove the existence of an afterlife or the theory that there are more people than souls in this world. I am here to figure out how you knew about an explosion that was just proved an accident.”\n\n“Oh ho ho, it was proved an accident? Doesn’t that make your case rather flimsy?”\n\n“There are still seven workers who died. The exact number you mention in your nine-one-one call. Every case I’ve worked with some accurate prediction like this has turned out to be a scam.”\n\nSarah challenges him with an aha finger. “Are you calling me a con artist?” She’s mocking incredulity. “Tell me how this would possibly work, in your mind. Where is the con? What would any of this have to do with a grift?”\n\nGrant stands, putting cash on the table to pay for them both. “I don’t know. But the next step is to test this.”\n\nSarah realizes he’s preparing to leave and gulps down the rest of her tea. “Wait, hang on. Test?”\n\n“I need to get to Denver. Can you bring Marigold back in tomorrow for another session?”\n\nSarah frowns at Grant. “Maybe. Why?”\n\n“Call me once you have her under. When she’s speaking as Brian.”\n\n“Where will you be?”\n\nGrant is already halfway out the door when he answers her.\n\n“Outside Brian’s house.”",

      "content": "Interlude: How Quickly Grant Forgot Who He Was\n\nINTERLUDE: HOW QUICKLY GRANT FORGOT WHO HE WAS\n\nGrant Lukather used to live an ascetic life. No girlfriend. No significant relationships. No hobbies—at least none he would discuss. His coworkers considered him hardworking, devoted, serious, but a bit suspicious. Jerry Holloway, who sat across from him at the Bureau for two years, put it this way: “Who doesn’t have any vices? No smoking, no drinking, the hardest drug I’ve seen him take is ibuprofen. If he doesn’t have, like, a gambling addiction or a sex dungeon, I almost feel bad for him.”\n\nBut two years ago, everything changed.\n\nBy then, at the age of thirty-three, Grant understood his behavior was the result of growing up with a strict set of rules versus a sense of safety. There was no such thing as unconditional, particularly when it came to emotions, especially one as overused as love. His father, a mechanical engineer for a jet manufacturer, made it clear to Grant when he was six years old: “I’m not obligated to feel one way or the other about you. I’ll keep you fed and housed, make sure you receive adequate care when you’re sick, and I will commit a percentage of my time on the weekends to support your pursuits. For anything else, you must earn it. Prove your value to me and I’ll reward you. You are an occupant of this house I pay for as an investment in your future. Love is for greeting cards. Achievement, though—that is real fulfillment.”\n\nGrant spoke with his mother, Laura, that same day, the way a child will go shopping for a better reality if the one presented to them is unappealing. When he related what Dad had said about love, Mom stared at the clock on the wall and nodded. “He believes that, except on the rare occasions he doesn’t. Maybe you’ll be lucky enough to find him when he’s too tired to cling to the propaganda he’s written for himself.”\n\nGrant didn’t know what that meant. But when she offered to tell him she loved him, he felt a pang of melancholy. It was as if she offered her love as a consolation prize. She said none of this directly to her son, but Grant internalized it as “If you aren’t getting what you need from your father, I will give it to you. But it won’t be the same. And I won’t volunteer it, or else you’ll think it’s pity disguised as affection. You have to learn to ask for what you want.”\n\nThese two worldviews of his parents built the machine inside Grant. He stopped himself from asking for emotional support because he had already been given the rules. A world where a child could simply be sad, or lonely, or scared of any of a million things that rightly scare children … that world didn’t exist in his household. When the darkness encroached on his waking mind in the late hours of the night, when the only sounds were the gurgling kitchen refrigerator and the moths bumping against the screen door, Grant would feel himself spiral into a depression. Most feelings, it seemed, were problems to solve. And if he solved them by himself, he had the chance at recognition from his father and appreciation from his mother. But what if a feeling needed that same recognition to solve it?\n\nWhen he had lost the science fair to the rich girl who memorized her speech about electromagnetics because her father was a software developer who did all her work, Grant cried to his mother. It had been seven months since Dad had told him, “I’m proud of you, Grant.” Dad never said, “I love you,” but impressing him was nearly the same. Mom, however, used “love” casually, but she didn’t love that he’d earned second place in the science fair. Grant had built a solar car from balsa wood and other parts acquired all on his own. He did it because he knew his mother cared about renewable energy and his father was a car enthusiast.\n\nThe work and the prize ribbon got him the following: a grunt of confirmation from Dad, followed by a shrug. A gentle shoulder rub from Mom and a smile, with the three words: “Now you know.”\n\nHe grew up chasing after certificates, Scout patches, and trophies. The collection on his wall was a display: I am loved this much. But it was his only evidence to this claim.\n\nCollege shook some of this loose. He was dropped into a melting pot of other ideas and other kids, and all of them had their own bespoke, dysfunctional histories. He could intellectualize that emotional well-being was a lighthouse built on a fault line. During his adolescence, it had fallen over time and again. But he still didn’t know what to do about it, and the girls who found him attractive were always first drawn to his academic excellence or his athletic ability, reinforcing the machine inside him.\n\nAt twenty-six, and fresh out of the Academy at Quantico, Grant was a slightly softer version of his father, except instead of engineering, his pursuit was law enforcement. He had grown up obeying emotional laws, and so the thought of others out there breaking laws and getting away with it made him deeply jealous at first, and then driven to seek justice later. He’d had relationships in college and beyond that lasted as long as his partner could go without demanding to hear him tell her, “I love you.” One girlfriend jumped right in and told him those words on their third date. He broke up with her on the spot. He had little patience for liars and con artists, of which he was sure she was one.\n\nBut then, two years ago happened. When he became a different person.\n\nThe rest of the fourteen-person staff at the Predictive Analytics office immediately had a betting pool for it. Some believed Grant had finally started taking drugs. Nothing so contradictory to his character as cocaine or acid, but something legalized. The top pick was ketamine, under supervision of a doctor. “He’s riding the k-train, look at him,” Jerry said.\n\nThe next most popular idea was a grim one, but held the most merit: Grant’s father passed away a month earlier. Heart attack. It took a few weeks, but perhaps all the internal mechanisms that parenting had built inside Grant finally shut down, and with the mourning of his father he also felt a kind of exorcism. He could let go of the rules of the game he’d always had to abide by now that the inventor of that game was gone.\n\nBut most of the women in the office dismissed this option. A man doesn’t change his hairstyle and suddenly wear primary colors because his father passed. He doesn’t start laughing at jokes for the first time since they all met him. No, this had to be something simpler.\n\nHe had fallen in love.\n\nCharlotte met him in a neighborhood park. Grant had gone there regularly to jog before work in the mornings because it had a gravel path that was almost exactly one mile in its loop. He found Charlotte calling for a cat, whom she described as “extra-floofy” with a feather-duster tail. Grant peeled off from his two-mile routine to help her look. When he asked her what its name was, Charlotte said, “I have no idea.” That’s when Grant learned it wasn’t Charlotte’s cat—she had just seen a stray in the park for three days in a row, and that suggested to her it had been abandoned here.\n\n“That’s why you’re out here at the crack of dawn? Looking for someone else’s pet?”\n\nCharlotte blinked at Grant as if he were making the most basic of observations. “Nobody likes to be abandoned.”\n\nThey reunited the next morning, with Charlotte back on her search of this fabled longhair stray cat, and once again there was no sighting of it. Grant found himself sacrificing his jogs to help Charlotte, but couldn’t explain why. On their third day of touring the park for the cat that Charlotte had nicknamed Vanessa von Plumage, she coaxed Grant to a café afterward where she treated him to a coffee. There, he told her he didn’t have any pets—he wasn’t allowed them as a boy and didn’t see the use for them now. Charlotte sized him up and decided it meant he was a dog person, “But one of the very smart ones, you’d have no patience for derpy dogs.”\n\nShe was an artist. She made her rent with a webcomic featuring a mischievous cat, but she aspired to be a fine artist with a gallery of her own one day.\n\nOn their third date, they kissed, and Grant could hear his heartbeat in his ears for several minutes after that. She didn’t wear perfume, but there was a specific sensation to her that, when she was close enough to Grant, flipped off switches in his brain and flipped on new, different ones.\n\nOn their fifth date, he stammered when trying to say good night after making out. The hardwired connection from his brain to his mouth had never failed him before. Charlotte smiled like her cartoon cat and invited him in.\n\nA month later, Grant adopted a dog.\n\nCharlotte was never put off or resentful of Grant’s withholding of words of affection, but she became increasingly curious about him. She once put the palm of her hand on his bare chest when they were lying in bed one morning and said, rather matter-of-factly, “There are jars full of things in here you’ve never labeled.”\n\nShe was just as much a mystery to him, as well. When she stayed over, she would make him a boxed lunch, in which he’d find a sticky note with a quick doodle of her cartoon cat and a note like Have a good day! Knock something off a counter. Another joked, These are worth a few bucks each, if you ever need quick cash sell them on my Etsy! And then on a Thursday, after his having done nothing remarkable at all that week, one note with his tuna salad read, Proud of you. This declaration, attached to nothing he had done or achieved, felt like a joke. A trick.\n\nGrant confronted her about it that night, with the same voice he used when interrogating suspects. Charlotte was nonplussed at first, cleaning her brushes with water in a pint glass.\n\n“Proud of what?”\n\n“Just in general. Isn’t for anything specific.”\n\n“It must be. That’s how it works.”\n\nHer eyes flashed, heralding her smile. “Is that so?”\n\n“Yes. Otherwise it’s meaningless.”\n\n“Not to me, it isn’t.”\n\nGrant took a half step backward. “What?”\n\n“I wouldn’t have written it if I didn’t mean it, Grant. I’m proud of you. It’s a lot of things. But, it’s more about who you are. How you’re letting yourself change. So many people resist change, even when they want it to happen. But you, you’re charging into it. And no one has asked you to do any of it—at the very least, I haven’t. So, yeah, it’s inspiring, Grant. You’re pretty amazing for it. And I’m gonna tell you that on a sticky note.” She looked at him. “You can decide it’s meaningless to you. Just know it means a lot to me.”\n\nThe idea of two people using two sets of rules for the world while living in the same house … it broke Grant’s brain.\n\nThe most tectonic shift for Grant happened two nights later, when Charlotte casually confessed to him something that bordered on wishful mysticism.\n\nHe’d been at work late and hadn’t arrived home until well past midnight. Einstein, the dog, snored loudly on the tile floor of the bathroom. He found Charlotte asleep, too, in his bed, after she’d agreed just to come over and walk the dog that night. Before he put his weight on the bed and slid in beside her, she woke and said, “You’re home,” and then turned to face him. He asked if he’d made a noise or something. That’s when she said, rather nonchalantly, “My body senses you. I can tell when you’re near. And it comforts me, but it also makes my heart beat a little faster.”\n\nGrant thought to himself, in a voice much like his father’s, Nonsense.\n\nSo, over the next six weeks, he tested it: showing up a few minutes late to dinner dates and making an approach well out of her line of sight, then standing nearby while she was on her phone. He tried that three times, and each time he watched her react with something akin to a tremble, and she’d look around for him right away. It confounded him.\n\nHe began to consider that she might have caught sight of him in the reflection of a window somewhere, or another customer or the waitstaff had made eye contact with him briefly, giving him up. But he also had to deal with the fact that, like nearly everyone else today, she had had her head down and was focused on some idle app on her phone each time. She wasn’t paying attention until he was close, and then it was as if a bell rang that only she heard.\n\nThen came the night of her sister’s party. Emily was spiky in all the ways Charlotte was smooth. Emily was loud, unafraid of being vulgar, and worked as a bank manager. Grant was first to arrive to the party, right on time, to be judged by Emily right away as “the one person who took a start time seriously.”\n\nGrant found himself apologizing for being punctual for the first time in his life, and he then realized he’d left his bottle of wine in the car and excused himself, while Emily said she’d leave the door cracked for him—another habit neither he nor Charlotte would abide.\n\nOn his return, he heard Emily in the kitchen and ducked into the powder room to wash up. He stared at his reflection for a minute, wondering how he had remained in a relationship for so long when so much of it still felt like a complete mystery to him. He detected that anxiety in his stomach creeping in, heralding the moment he always chose to break up with his girlfriend in other relationships.\n\nOn the other side of the powder room door, he heard Emily let Charlotte in, and the two spoke in a catty shorthand like siblings who knew each other too well. Then Charlotte asked, “Who else is here?”\n\n“You have me all to yourself for a bit.”\n\n“Get me a drink, I’ll be right there.”\n\nGrant had one hand on the doorknob, ready to step out and greet Charlotte, yet frozen in place as some part of him began to argue this was the time to call it all off, before gaining the ire or the approval of her sister. Then his phone buzzed in his pocket. He checked the text, from Charlotte:\n\nYOU WIN. I just got that same feeling, but this time you’re not here. I hope this isn’t a bad omen.\n\nGrant stepped into the foyer, making Charlotte jump. Her eyes flashed with a microburst of joy and she hugged him. “I just texted you, but don’t look at it yet.”\n\nHe obliged her, not admitting he’d already seen it. She studied his face, sensing the anxiety he thought he’d hidden well under a mask of calm assertiveness.\n\n“I have to tell you something, here, before—before we go in,” he stammered.\n\n“Of course.” She kept her hands on his. Not squeezing, but not letting go. Her thumb made gentle, lazy circles around one of his knuckles. “I’m listening.”\n\nGrant knew the words. He had the vocabulary for them. He understood what they meant. He also knew they were true, and the truth had never scared him before. But he was terrified.\n\n“It was, uh, it was my understanding, to get the kind of affection you give me, you must earn it. Do good, excel in some challenge, and, and the reward is something like what you’re doing with your thumb right now. But you are breaking my brain with whatever supernatural sense you have. It’s like you’re saying it isn’t bound to what a person does, it can just occur spontaneously and live in what two people are, together.”\n\nCharlotte beamed at him and nodded. “Yeah.”\n\nGrant found his eyes getting wet. “But, you realize that makes no sense. Right?”\n\n“It doesn’t even try to make sense.”\n\n“Well … Well, I don’t like it. I don’t trust it. There are no rules for it.”\n\n“Would you spend some more time with the idea and see if it grows on you?”\n\nHe tried not to look at her because the patience in her eyes kept triggering whatever was making him start to cry. “Maybe. But I don’t trust this.” He was repeating himself now.\n\n“Grant, I think it’s time I tell you something that could help you trust this.”\n\nShe pulled herself close and stood on tiptoe to bring her lips to his ear.\n\n“I love you,” she whispered.\n\nIt was the first time he believed it in his heart.",

      "content": "5. Down the Rabbit Hole\n\nDOWN THE RABBIT HOLE\n\nGrant spasms awake in the driver’s seat of his car. He blinks, then winces and rubs his sore back. I need to try sleeping pills, he thinks. Something that will stop me from dreaming.\n\nBeyond his windshield, an empty parking lot gives him a view of a wide building that looks like a contemporary house, with wood-slat walls and abstract sculptures at its entry.\n\nRolling his neck and popping a breath mint into his mouth, he takes a moment before climbing out of his car.\n\nHe approaches the building as a young man unlocks the glass front door and holds it open for him. “Welcome,” the man says. “You’re here right at opening. An artist?”\n\n“Just a fan. But I knew an artist.” Grant smiles, but his eyes are tired and distant.\n\nGrant steps inside, walking past the sign: KIRKLAND MUSEUM OF FINE & DECORATIVE ART.\n\n* * *\n\nGrant stands in the center of a room, slowly turning in place. Around him, the museum walls are lined with vibrant paintings. Spikes and swirls of colors that evoke the smell of autumn. One piece looks like it might be a microscopic representation of rough quartz.\n\nHis attention locks on to one piece. He’s pulled toward it, as if under a spell.\n\nIts colors are a mixture of aged parchment, rust, dark chocolate, and blood. The abstract shapes seem to chase after one another, part wild and chaotic, part geometric. A piece that seems hard as sharp rock in places, and ineffable as water in others.\n\nGrant checks the title of the piece. Trio.\n\nHe opens his weathered notebook, unfolds the slip of paper, and finds a name on the list, at number eight. Vance Kirkland. Denver, Colorado.\n\nIn the utter silence of the space, Grant’s phone rings, startling him.\n\nA museum security guard steps in from the next exhibit room, frowning at Grant.\n\nGrant holds up a finger and hurries for the front door.\n\nOn the third ring, he answers, stepping back outside.\n\n“Yeah,” he mutters.\n\n“It’s Sarah. Why are you whispering?”\n\n“Just stepping outside. When is your session?”\n\n“In an hour. Is that enough time for you to get there?”\n\nGrant looks over at the skyline of downtown. “I’m in Denver already.”\n\n“Wow. Did you drive all night?”\n\n“I’m used to it.”\n\n“So, should I just walk Marigold through a normal session and call you after, or what?”\n\n“Call me when she claims to be Brian Huntley again.”\n\nSarah scoffs, “Claims?”\n\nGrant remains skeptical, even now. “Have her recall today’s events as Brian.”\n\n“I get the sense you don’t really respect my profession.”\n\nGrant balks. “Pardon?”\n\n“Well, you don’t believe in a foundational truth about this kind of therapy, and you see no moral or ethical issue with hijacking a client session for some sort of test or experiment. Am I right?”\n\nGrant is thrown off guard. “Uh…”\n\n“I mean, you know? This isn’t a good look for you. And I don’t want to cause any further trauma for Marigold here. I’m responsible for her.”\n\n“Right, right. Okay.”\n\n“Tell me why I should help you, again?”\n\n“I see now I wasn’t clear with you about the situation. If I can’t come back to my superiors with evidence that proves your theory, or something concrete that dismisses your culpability, it doesn’t matter that the pipeline explosion was deemed an accident. The case will be reopened to account for your call the day before and pulled off my desk, where it then goes to the Bureau, and they won’t have the time or the inclination to look at any sketches you draw for them in a notebook, they will just slap you with felony charges and throw you in prison.”\n\nHe ends the call and storms off to his sedan.\n\n* * *\n\nSarah drops her phone heavily on her kitchen counter. She shouts at it in a fit of frustration, as if it would deliver a message to Grant this way.\n\n“Asshole!”\n\nTravis steps in a moment later, eyebrows raised at her. “Are we okay?”\n\nSarah slumps. Her hands find her protein drink and she returns to stirring it.\n\n“Just a work thing, sorry.”\n\nTravis lets out a breath of relief and undoes his necktie to try again. “Well, it’s day two.”\n\n“Hm?”\n\n“First real round of witness testimony in court today. This job is never boring, I can tell you that.”\n\n“Oh. Right. Yeah. Good luck.”\n\nShe stares out the kitchen window as she stirs. Travis looks up from knotting his tie and watches her a moment.\n\n“What’s wrong?”\n\nSarah blinks. “What do you mean?”\n\n“You’re nervous.”\n\n“Am I?”\n\n“You never let the spoon rattle against the glass when you’re calm.”\n\nSarah pulls the spoon out of her drink and takes a breath.\n\n“Busted.” Then: “Do you still have access to the federal agency database? With all the employee profiles?”\n\n“I think so.”\n\n“Can you find out about this man?”\n\nShe gives Travis a business card. Grant’s card.\n\n“Sure.” He looks at the name, frowning. “Why do you have this guy’s card?”\n\n“He came to my office.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Thought I could help him with a case.”\n\n“You?”\n\nSarah hears the disbelief in Travis’s voice, and it shakes some part of her, deep inside.\n\nTravis must see the pained look that flits on Sarah’s face because he softens immediately. “I’ll look into it, of course. But if he comes to your office again, you call me right away, okay? Just to be safe.”\n\n“Okay.”\n\nAn awkward silence follows, as Travis’s attention returns to the card. He mutters to himself, “Predictive Analytics?”\n\nSarah clears her throat. “What if this is the only way to help my client? Like, what if I can’t help this one particular client without him?”\n\nTravis gently touches her on the shoulder and looks her in the eye. “Do you think a guy from Homeland Security can do your job better than you?”\n\nSarah opens her mouth to reply, but thinks better of it.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Rocky Mountains stand proudly in the distance, a hazy backdrop beyond the row of modest houses on this suburban street. The lush grass and the green on the fir trees make it completely different from the New Mexico neighborhood Grant had visited earlier in the week.\n\nHe sits in his car parked at the curb, chewing on a breakfast muffin and staring down the block at a specific house.\n\nA Toyota sedan in need of a wash is parked in the driveway of this one-story home with a small flower garden along the front porch.\n\nA moment later, a man in a terry-cloth bathrobe and slip-on shoes shuffles out the front door, his hair untamed from bed. He makes his way to the newspaper in his driveway and slowly returns inside, glancing at the front-page headline on his way back.\n\nGrant sits forward in his seat and stops chewing. This man meets the description of Brian Huntley—the detective with Denver PD that Marigold claims to have been in her previous life. His features are as she’d described. He’s not yet old enough for the salt-and-pepper hair, but his sideburns have hints of gray already. Grant can see a pack of cigarettes in Brian’s bathrobe pocket, and the top of a Zippo lighter. The detective steps into his house and shuts the door like it’s a normal day in his life.\n\nGrant picks up his smartphone and stares at the screen. “Come on, Sarah…”\n\n* * *\n\nSarah sits back in her chair next to the metronome. It thrums softly. She attempts to calm herself with a breath, but her exhale is punctuated with tremors, and her knees bounce.\n\n“As you drift into a peaceful trance, you feel that ribbon around your waist. Four. Three.”\n\nMarigold lies on the couch, her eyes closed, her breath deep and relaxed.\n\n* * *\n\nThe metronome looms over Marigold, impossibly tall, like a mythic structure. Particulate swims in the air around her, catching light from some unseen source. The particles glimmer most intensely around Marigold’s ribbon.\n\nOnce more, Sarah’s voice drifts in and echoes around her: “This ribbon binds you to the conscious world. But you are free. Two. One.”\n\nMarigold pulls at the knot around her waist and plunges through the floor. The fireflies scatter as if reacting to the sound of a shotgun.\n\nSarah’s voice comes to her as a distant navigator while the world snaps into resolution beneath her. The snowy caps of the Rocky Mountains have punched through a cloud line that Marigold falls through, only to continue her free fall to Denver below. She screams as she falls, in a panic, missing whatever direction Sarah’s voice gives her.\n\n“What?! Where am I?!”\n\nA Denver suburb rushes up to meet her. One near parks and an airport.\n\nSarah’s voice carries on the rush of wind of Marigold’s skydive:\n\n“You are the one you were before Marigold. Step into that life.”\n\nThe ground rushes up at terminal velocity. Marigold sees her imminent death, squeezes her eyes shut, and—\n\n* * *\n\nBrian Huntley drops his cigarette lighter in a sudden spasm.\n\nFor a moment, he looks startled; terrified, even. But, like a phantom feeling of falling when he’s half asleep in bed, the sensation passes. He’s at the kitchen counter, the newspaper splayed out before him like forensic evidence, and his coffee steaming nearby.\n\nBrian picks up his lighter, but decides in a moment of superstition he won’t have a morning smoke just yet. He returns to the paper.\n\n* * *\n\nGrant is idly drumming his fingers on the steering wheel when his phone rings. He picks up before it rings twice and, instead of saying hello, simply gets to the point:\n\n“Have you started?”\n\nSarah makes a flustered noise on her end, then, in almost a whisper: “I’ve regressed Marigold, yes. What do you want to know?”\n\n“Ask her what Brian does today.”\n\nGrant hears Sarah speak in her formal therapist voice, keeping Grant on the line.\n\n“Brian. It’s just past eleven in the morning. What are you doing now?”\n\nGrant hears the throaty, lowered voice of Marigold, but she’s too far from the phone to catch her answer. He waits impatiently for Sarah to relay the information.\n\nA moment later, Sarah whispers, “He’s reading the paper. The kids are in school and his wife is at work, he has the house to himself. He’s on second shift at the precinct this month.”\n\nGrant looks down at his notebook, where he’s scribbled some information from research he’s pulled this morning. On one line, a bullet point is written: second shift. Grant circles that. Other factoids include the make/model of the car he drives, his partner’s full name, and the names of his wife and children, where he lived prior to this address, and a dozen other tidbits of data someone with a federal agency authorization could acquire. Along the margins of this page are little doodles, too. Trees of different shapes. An occasional leaf.\n\nThe sketches and the list of trivia do not seem to be related.\n\n“Ask him how he’s dressed.”\n\nSarah balks at this. “You want to know what he’s wearing?”\n\n“Just ask.”\n\nMore muttering; this time even Sarah’s voice is obscured. Grant supposes she’s decided to cover the mouthpiece with her hand now.\n\nAfter a moment, she replies in a hushed tone, “Sweats and a bathrobe.”\n\nGrant clenches his jaw. Okay, that’s specific, but could be coincidental. He sucks in a breath. “What does he drive to work?” he asks, while staring at the pickup.\n\nAnother moment of muted conversation, then Sarah is back.\n\n“A Dodge pickup.”\n\nGrant sits up, eyes slightly wider. Got you. Ha.\n\nThen Sarah follows with “But his wife, Luda, has to get some bark chips from the nursery after work, so he’s taking her Toyota today.”\n\nGrant deflates. Begins scribbling multiple question marks around a separate, small list of items, under the header Theories. One is listed as remote camera aimed at house for live feed. Grant looks around for any sign of surveillance equipment in the neighborhood ahead of him, but he’s done this already—when he first arrived. And he still can’t find anything that isn’t professionally hidden on or in a fixture that would be permanent enough to use reliably for a trick like this.\n\nHe starts drumming again with his pencil on the steering wheel now, thinking of his next move, when Sarah nudges him on the call.\n\n“What now?”\n\n“Ask him … Actually, ask him how his day goes. What does he do, where does he go, anything unusual or frustrating? That sort of thing.”\n\n* * *\n\nAt the kitchen counter, Brian finishes off his mug of coffee. He sets it down and blinks.\n\nSoon after, he steps out of the door, dressed in a suit that needs an iron, putting one arm through a raincoat as he uses the key fob on the Toyota. As he goes, Marigold’s voice narrates Brian’s day like some audiobook narrator:\n\n“I go to work.\n\n“Allen has a lead on a homicide case. It looks like a copycat from a serial killer in Michigan more than a decade ago, but that perp was caught. We go round and round about whether to bring in the FBI. Because if you do, it’s like giving up. Their caseload is typically maxed out, so they rank incoming casework on a priority listing, and since nobody will believe this to be anything more than someone trying to look like they’re a serial killer still on the loose, my bet is the field agents won’t put many man-hours into the work. Particularly since they don’t have a satellite office here in Denver, so they’d have to fly someone in and expense their investigation, which is pricey. Nah, what will happen, in my opinion, if we give the Feds a call is they’ll tell us, ‘Thanks, we got this,’ and that’s the last we’ll hear from them. Meanwhile, the victim’s mother will call us every day asking why aren’t we doing our job. Which, I mean, she’s not wrong.\n\n“Allen is more excited about closing cases he feels he can solve in a day. And this one looks tricky. The previous case is about Leonard Church, whom the press branded as the Ash Killer. Because he would smear a thumb of ash on the foreheads of his victims. It seemed like vibhuti, from Hinduism, but the killer had no ties with that religion, nor was the ash made from the remains of a cow, which is typically where you get it. Instead the ash used was dated to be much, much older. Detectives never found the supply of whatever ash Church was using, but he confessed to them and knew details of the murders only the killer would know.\n\n“But now the ash has been used on someone else, here in Denver. Or at least something that matches close to the same evidence from the previous case. And I spend most of the shift arguing with Allen about our next steps. I even start a timeline on the whiteboard, putting up what we know about the copycat Ash Killer and what we have on this recent homicide.”\n\n* * *\n\nGrant interrupts on his end of the phone, “That’s fine. Stop there.”\n\n“Stop?”\n\n“He gets to work on time, yes?”\n\n“I guess?”\n\n“Right. Call me back in five minutes.”\n\nJust as Sarah starts to protest, Grant ends the call and climbs out of his car.\n\nHe marches for Brian Huntley’s house, occasionally looking around and behind him. Approaching Brian’s driveway, Grant glances briefly at the front door. No one is peering out at Grant. In another dozen steps, Grant passes by the Toyota. As he does, he clicks open a pocketknife from within his jacket pocket and, in one swift motion, bends down to tie his shoe and quickly stabs the knife into the driver’s-side rear tire of Brian’s car. It punctures the rubber and emits a steady hiss. After a moment of Grant pantomiming trying his shoe, he pulls the knife free with a small twist to widen the puncture hole and returns to his walk.\n\nHe stays on his path for a block, then circles back, walking on the other side of the street for his return. Grant’s body language seems relaxed and distracted on his phone as he walks, but his eyes flit to front doors, to cars, and to Brian’s driveway as he passes it from across the road. Outside of a woman jogging, no one pays him any attention.\n\nGrant is back in his car within five minutes. From his seat, he can tell the tire is now fully deflated.\n\nBarely a minute later, Brian exits his house, dressed for work.\n\nGrant holds his phone up—seemingly as if he’s looking at a map, but his camera is active, and Grant takes two snapshots of Brian on the move.\n\nBrian steps to his car, holding his phone to his ear, distracted. He doesn’t notice the flat tire.\n\nGrant keeps the phone trained on the Toyota. Watches as Brian starts the car. Using the camera to zoom in, Grant sees Brian frown and say something to the person on the other end of the call, then Brian drops his phone in the passenger seat and he steps back out. The ding ding of a low-tire alert on the car’s dash can be heard faintly in the quiet moment.\n\nBrian finds the culprit, gives it a little nudge with his shoe, and shakes his head.\n\nGrant watches him check his watch. Then, Brian opens the trunk.\n\nGrant takes another photo.\n\n* * *\n\n“How was I?” Marigold rubs her eyes, sitting up on Sarah’s couch.\n\nSarah wants to ask Marigold a hundred questions. Did you know your past life is someone else alive right now, approximately your age? But Sarah fears what damage that might do, what spell might break, psychologically speaking, if Sarah revealed to her patient the nature of this phenomenon. So she simply asks, “Do you remember anything?”\n\n“I was that man again, wasn’t I? I taste coffee in the back of my mouth.”\n\n“Anything else?”\n\n“I have a song stuck in my head. But I don’t recognize it.”\n\nSarah walks her to the door with a hand gently on Marigold’s shoulder, nodding. “Let me know if anything else comes to you.”\n\nMarigold takes another step, and her body spasms.\n\nSarah feels it in her hand touching Marigold. “Marigold?”\n\nThe woman’s eyes roll up in her head, and she collapses like a marionette whose strings were abruptly cut.\n\nSarah gasps. Tahlia stands suddenly at her desk, unsure of what to do or where to go. “What happened?”\n\n“Call an ambulance,” Sarah tells her.\n\nSarah hovers over Marigold and checks her wrist for a pulse.",

      "content": "TIME CAN BREAK, BUT TIME CAN BREAK PEOPLE WITH IT\n\nGrant lets out a long breath and mutters to himself, “The trick has fallen apart.” Outside, Brian digs into the Toyota’s trunk and emerges with a temporary tire. But when he puts it on the driveway, it bounces sloppily. And when he applies some pressure, he discovers even the temp tire is low. Brian throws his hands up in defeat to no one in particular, then tosses a tire iron in the trunk and hefts the temporary tire with hands black from gripping rubber.\n\nGrant steps out of his car and starts toward Brian. He had deliberately chosen to avoid speaking to the Denver man in person prior to this—if he wasn’t knowingly involved in whatever Marigold is doing with Sarah in California, Grant didn’t want to complicate the life of a fellow detective. And there was the nagging sense that maybe, in some indirect way, Grant’s role in this elaborate scheme was to be the one to involve Brian, the way some marks in confidence games are merely used to rope in a bigger target. But now, having proven the prediction of the day false, Grant is confident that was not the case. Also, having watched Brian attempt to use a too-small jack for the slashed tire, Grant has begun feeling pangs of guilt for ruining the cop’s day.\n\nGrant is sifting through his wallet to pull out his AAA Roadside Assistance card when his phone rings. Brian turns his head that way to see who’s nearby just as Grant turns around and answers the call.\n\n“What did you do?!” Sarah hisses.\n\n“What?”\n\n“Marigold just collapsed and had a seizure in my office. Tahlia called an ambulance.”\n\n“What do you mean—she just fell?”\n\n“Dropped like a rock. She’s awake now, but can’t stop shaking.”\n\nGrant looks back at Brian. At the car.\n\n“Uhm…”\n\n“Grant. What the hell did you do?”\n\n* * *\n\nThe lights of the Ferris wheel on the Santa Monica Pier twinkle, spinning lazily and chased by their twins in the reflection from the dark Pacific. Sarah can see the pier from her bonus-room window if she turns the overhead light off and stands in the dark. It used to soothe her, but tonight she bites her nails.\n\n“I checked on him.”\n\nStartled by the voice, Sarah jumps and turns. Travis stands at the threshold, backlit by the light in their foyer.\n\n“What?”\n\n“That Fed. You know that department he’s in? Predictive Analytics? It’s barely more than a hotline for psychics who call in to the FBI and claim they know the next bombing or something.”\n\nSarah steps more into the light, hugging herself. “Okay. But it’s not a scam.”\n\nTravis undoes his necktie and makes a dismissive sound. “Well. It’s not like they run around with guns and badges. Nobody takes them seriously.”\n\nJoin the club, Sarah thinks.\n\n“Anyway, according to what I found on file, the agent, Grant Lukather? He was on leave of absence until last week.”\n\n“Oh?”\n\n“You know the wildfires that tore through Oregon, couple months ago? He lost his house.”\n\nA sudden sadness overcomes Sarah. “That’s … actually terrible.”\n\n“Worse. A woman who was dog-sitting for him died, along with his dog. He sounds like a country-western song.”\n\nSarah tries to ignore how callous Travis sounds with his remark. Instead, her mind races with this new information about Grant. “He lost everything?”\n\nTravis starts toward the bedroom. He keeps talking, expecting Sarah to follow him back. “Yeah. Heartbreaking. Point is, he’s gotta be emotionally unstable. So if he bothers you again, let me know. He’s a phone call away from being thrown off active duty.”\n\nSarah stays in the threshold of her bonus room another few breaths and rakes her fingers through her hair, thinking.\n\nTravis calls after her, “Babe? Coming to bed?”\n\n“Yeah … Well, actually, no. I need to do some inspiration work for a bit first.”\n\nShe turns on the light and disappears from Travis’s view.\n\nTravis frowns. Steps back toward the front room. “You wanna talk about anything? Sometimes you work when you have something on your mind.”\n\n“I don’t have enough figured out to put words to it, yet. It’s okay.”\n\nTravis pauses. He knows the tone of her voice when she’s troubled. “I’m here for you, you know. I may show up late like I did tonight, but I’m here now.”\n\n“Thanks,” Sarah replies after an awkward pause.\n\n* * *\n\nGrant is an hour into Nevada on I-15 when his superior calls him.\n\n“Grant. It’s Omar. Talk to me.”\n\n“Sir. I … I don’t know where to start.”\n\n“Where are you? Are you on the road?”\n\n“On my way back to Los Angeles. Had to drive up to Denver for the day.”\n\n“What for?”\n\n“There’s a detective at Precinct Eighteen involved in this case, somehow.”\n\n“The gas main explosion in New Mexico?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You think he knew about the explosion ahead of time?”\n\n“No. At least, not that I can tell. He hasn’t left Colorado in the last year, except to visit his family in Michigan for Thanksgiving. I had Alex pull phone records and I didn’t see any connection there, either.”\n\n“Then how is he involved?”\n\n“The woman who allegedly predicted the explosion has implicated him, indirectly.”\n\n“Grant, I’ll be honest, I’m not following any of this.”\n\nGrant lets out a ragged breath. “Honestly, neither am I.”\n\n“You want help on this? Are you holding up? Nicole is on the West Coast, I could send her down to pair up with you.”\n\n“Let me first shake a few more branches, sir. Can I put Alex on more data work?”\n\n“Please. I think he plays League of Legends here at the office when he’s not busy. So keep him busy. What are you thinking?”\n\n“At this point we just need some common traits among the people of interest. See if any active cases this cop has overlap with a woman in Santa Monica. The detective is Brian Huntley. That’s H-U-N-T-L-E-Y. And the woman’s name is Marigold Chu. In fact, have him look at cold cases while he’s at it. Maybe there’s a victim or a suspect.”\n\n“Marigold Chu? Where is she now?”\n\n“Right now? In Cedars-Sinai hospital.”\n\n* * *\n\nThe morning sun peers through blinds in Marigold’s private room. Heart-rate monitoring hardware tracks her vitals, anchored to her by a wrap on her biceps. An IV with a saline drip stands beside her bed like a skinny bodyguard with a water pouch for a head. She doesn’t like it—it feels like an insect constantly crawling on her forearm where the nurse inserted the lead.\n\nMarigold awkwardly adjusts her sitting position in bed, her breakfast tray wheeled over her lap, but her food has hardly been touched. She uses the tray instead as a laptop stand, distracting herself with a YouTube video of a concert performance, played through earbuds to prevent disturbing others. Her heart rate has remained elevated, but since she started self-medicating with YouTube, it’s not been so fast as to trigger a nurse visit. Marigold sways to the music and takes a sip of her water.\n\nA notification from another browser tab gets her attention. NEW REPLY at Citizen Sleuth. Marigold quickly tabs over to a forum website.\n\nThe forum is a hive of activity today, as on many days. Its main screen shows more than two hundred users online now, in various threads, reading or posting or lurking. Marigold’s own username here is Goldeneye, and her avatar is a shiny golden magnifying glass.\n\nMarigold finds the thread in question and clicks on it. Its subject line reads RETURN OF THE ASH KILLER?\n\nThe thread is a month old, and already several pages deep. Marigold has frequented the thread and even commented here and there. She’s always been fascinated by true crime and loves a sense of belonging to a community, like she does with her fellow sleuths. Recently, the murders committed by Leonard Church—known as the Ash Killer—have sparked her curiosity, especially now that a new victim has been found in Denver, and the murders appear to be starting again.\n\nShe reads the latest speculation by a Colorado Sleuth using the handle SkiMom81: There’s no way it’s the same person. They caught Church ten years ago. He confessed. The only way he could be involved is if there were more than one killer back then, collaborating. But that, as we all know here, is spectacularly rare.\n\n* * *\n\nGrant finds Sarah pacing outside the hospital. They catch each other’s eye at the same moment, and a flash of recognition crosses their faces. They’re both working on little sleep, burdened by a concept that was at first wondrous, but now shakes them to their core. And as of now, they’re the only ones who know about it.\n\n“How is she?” Grant asks when he gets close.\n\n“Much better. They’re releasing her this afternoon if she doesn’t relapse.”\n\n“Okay. Do we know what happened to her?”\n\nSarah looks almost accusatorily at Grant. “Do you?”\n\nAs Grant starts to answer, a patient and his family exit the hospital, and both Grant and Sarah realize they’ve started their private conversation by the front doors.\n\nSarah pulls Grant to the cafeteria.\n\n* * *\n\nAt this hour, most tables are empty, and the sound of the kitchen echoes into the dining space. A pair of nurses sit folded over their late breakfast in one corner. Warm-hued paintings hang on the walls, evoking a caring, serene environment.\n\nGrant sees the look of expectation on Sarah’s face and musters a reply.\n\n“I slashed his tire.”\n\n“… What?”\n\n“It was a test. To change what Marigold predicted for the day. Have Brian Huntley experience something that would throw the rest of his schedule off-kilter. Disproving everything Marigold claimed.”\n\n“You slashed his tire?”\n\nGrant feels more self-conscious about it by the second, now that he’s with Sarah. “Yes.”\n\nSarah crosses her arms and crinkles her nose in a neon sign of tacit disapproval. “Well, it worked. You put Marigold in the hospital for it.”\n\n“You can’t blame me for that.” The words come out poorly. Almost pitifully. Grant feels a sense of something inside him stirring in reaction to Sarah’s attitude toward him. He shoves it away, squeezing it into a closet in his internal space.\n\n“Can’t I? She was fine until you changed the course of a life she had already lived. Do you not see how dangerous that is?”\n\n“She didn’t react the moment I deflated his tire, though.”\n\n“Of course not,” Sarah snaps. “I bet it happened the moment Brian realized he wasn’t going to get to work on time.”\n\n“Why do you think that?”\n\n“Why don’t you? Look, the connection here isn’t primarily time. It’s Marigold and Brian. If time is altered out there somewhere but the events have no impact on Marigold or Brian, would she feel it? I don’t think so! But when you mess with Brian’s life—when you alter something Marigold clearly remembered happening, I mean, come on. What did you think was going to happen, Grant?”\n\nGrant looks for some other topic, to veer away from his culpability in this. “What medically happened to Marigold? What does she remember?”\n\nSarah picks at the label on her soda bottle. “Not much. It’s another episode, much more acute this time.”\n\nGrant is pulled from his line of thought, looking right at Sarah. “Another?”\n\n“She came to me because she blacked out at work, had an hour of missing time, and a terrible headache afterward.”\n\nGrant sits forward, the hair on his neck prickling with concern. “So, you’re saying, what happened to her yesterday, when I altered her life as Brian, also happened before.”\n\nSarah blinks. “Yes … Why do you ask?” Her eyes brighten as she reads Grant’s expression. “You’ve figured something out, haven’t you?”\n\n“First, I need you to tell me about your therapy approach. How you learned to do what you do, anything relevant to your discovery with Marigold.”\n\n“Sure, okay.” She looks down at her hands. “Is it because you think I messed up, somewhere?”\n\n“What? No—not at all. Where did you—listen.” He lets out a steadying breath and takes another run at this. “Let me start with something that I never expected to say, as a detective or even as a person. So let me say it: Your therapy is real. It works. Or at the very least it has a real effect on your client, which is what matters. I don’t understand it. But I’m getting closer. Right now, your methods to reach into Marigold’s previous life, to connect with Brian, and to move along his timeline … I’ve never seen that done before. In fact, I would go so far as to say no one in history has done what you have.”\n\nSarah beams with pride. Her posture changes. Grant sees a shine to her eyes like they’re wet with emotion. For a moment, he recalls this same effect with himself as a boy, the first time his father said he was proud of Grant. She sighs and says, “Wow. I didn’t know I needed to hear that.”\n\n“It’s terrifying.”\n\n“Wait, what? Why?”\n\n“Because we’re talking about altering time. We’re changing history, it’s just we haven’t already lived through it. But she has.” Grant gestures upstairs, in the vague direction of Marigold’s room. “So when the life she lived somehow changes, it seems to affect her.”\n\nSarah catches up to his logic. “So the lost time, the headaches, the nightmares—they’ve been triggered by something in her life as Brian changing?”\n\n“This is a theory. I’m trying it on.”\n\n“But you believe it’s real?”\n\n“I currently don’t have any other explanation. And this theory makes too much sense to me, right now.”\n\nSarah smiles at him.\n\nHe notices. “What?”\n\n“It’s just nice to not be alone,” she says quietly but warmly.\n\n“What does that mean?”\n\n“Nothing.” She refocuses. “I have a timeline question for you. I don’t expect you to have an answer. But it’s been hurting my brain ever since you mentioned it.”\n\n“Tell me.”\n\n“Marigold remembers an entire life she lived as Brian. The whole experience, she’s carrying it around in her subconscious. And about two months ago, something changed. Someone altered Brian’s timeline, and while no one else would know, Marigold felt it. Right?”\n\n“Yes. As proven again with my experiment. I altered what should have been a normal day.”\n\n“So that’s where I’m lost. Who else could have changed Brian’s life?”\n\nGrant blinks. “Um.” He hadn’t gotten that far in his line of thought.\n\nSarah rolls on, “I mean, if it happened already, then someone or something messed with time before us. Back in early September. Something has altered what is supposed to happen. Or else Marigold wouldn’t have come to me in the first place. You know?”\n\n“Right, yeah.” Grant begins fussing with the salt shaker, unclogging it so the next person can use it. Sarah watches him with fresh interest. Is he being helpful even absentmindedly? Grant sighs. “I don’t know. Unless someone else out there is aware of their previous life—or simultaneous life, to use your term. Even just on a subconscious level. If they’re haunted by something that happened to them in their last life…” Grant snaps his fingers. “That reminds me of another question for you. Has Marigold ever had déjà vu? Like, has there been any moments in Brian’s life that have sort of bled through into hers? I’m not talking about when things went wrong for her, I just mean in general. Throughout her life.”\n\n“Yes! She talked about that in an early session. Fairly detailed, actually, and chronic since she was a child. But, nothing so specific it pointed at Brian.”\n\nGrant tries not to think of Charlotte and the fire. “But if someone were to know in their gut a tragedy would happen, because it’s how they were traumatized before, and they changed it, wouldn’t that create a ripple effect for everyone else affected?”\n\n“I think I see that.” Sara rubs her temples. “I never liked time-travel movies for this very reason. But, it makes sense.”\n\nGrant didn’t want it to make sense. He never wanted to be theorizing along this line of thought in the first place. It went against all his training. But he quietly admits to himself now, with Sarah, the theory follows a sort of logic.\n\n“The problem is,” he says, thinking aloud, “we have no way of knowing what was originally changed in Brian Huntley’s life to give Marigold these symptoms.”\n\nSarah considers the problem quietly. But then her face betrays her revelatory thought. Her excitement is clear. She would be terrible at card games, Grant thinks, but I’m so much more relaxed around people who don’t disguise their feelings.\n\n“Tell me. What is your idea?”\n\nSarah peels off a bit of her bottle’s label. “I didn’t say anything.”\n\n“You didn’t have to. Please, I’m listening.”\n\n“I’m worried you’re going to think it’s too weird to be true.”\n\n“All of it is. But I’m still here with you right now. We’re in it.”\n\nSarah nods. “Okay. It’s a basic tool in past-life regression. A simple question, like a prompt.”\n\n“What is the prompt?”\n\n“You ask about their most memorable moment in their life. What do they recall most? It drives you right to a milestone.”\n\nGrant starts to clean up after his meal, readying to leave. “Do you think you can regress Marigold here?”\n\n“It’s not the right environment. And she may have trouble making the connection now that she has trauma associated with the experience.”\n\nGrant leans back in his seat, deflated. “So, we are back to square one.”\n\n“I didn’t say that.”\n\n“Hm?”\n\n“Agent Lukather. Do you believe I’m a professional?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Because, outside of clients who seek me out, not many believe it. Not even my fiancé.”\n\n“I’m sorry. Wait—you’re engaged?”\n\n“Does that surprise you?”\n\n“No. I just didn’t notice a ring.”\n\nSarah looks at her hand and considers recounting the debate she and Travis had about diamonds and engagement rings, how he wanted some large stone, and how she prefers something slight, something sentimental, and how Travis felt it was important to show to the world he loves her enough to buy something too expensive or even gaudy. But with him the value is always measured in financial worth—he doesn’t understand a value that is purely emotional. And that made Sarah question if he was just being polite all the times she made cookies for his lunch, or when she knitted him that striped scarf for Christmas.\n\nGrant interrupts her train of thought, snapping his fingers. “Of course. I’m so sorry.”\n\nSarah crooks an eyebrow at him. “Sorry for what?”\n\n“It just took me a little while to catch up. You’re a professional. Which means, in your first session with Marigold, you would have asked her this prompt, correct?”\n\nSarah’s face lights up in confirmation. She can’t help but smile. “Yes. I did.”\n\n“What was her answer?”\n\n“His answer, you mean. As Brian Huntley.”\n\n“Right. What did he say was his most significant memory?”\n\n“Not catching the new Ash Killer.”\n\nGrant balks at this. “The murder case?”\n\n“Which is extremely strange, you know?”\n\nGrant shakes his head. “I don’t know. Tell me.”\n\n“I’ve asked this question a hundred times over the years. It’s always an event. A wedding, or the delivery of a child, or a funeral. Sometimes it’s a live event if they’re a performer. Or it’s the moment the person they have feelings for tells them the words I love you. But for Marigold’s previous life, for Brian…”\n\n“It’s the absence of an event.”\n\n“Exactly. He carries the regret of not doing something. And I’ve not had that happen before.”\n\nThe two of them are quiet at the table for a moment.\n\nFinally, Grant breaks the silence. “Do you think there was a timeline where Brian caught this killer, and that’s what Marigold would have recalled if you had regressed her the day before she blacked out?”\n\nSarah takes a swig of her drink. She shrugs, noncommittal, but then comes to terms with her own conjecture. “Actually … When did the reports of the killer start? Last month sometime?\n\nGrant checks his phone to confirm. “Early September.”\n\nSarah pulls her notebook from her handbag and thumbs through it. “That’s close to when Marigold experienced her first symptoms.”\n\nGrant stands up, taking his food tray with him. “I think we have a new experiment to try.”",

      "content": "7. Forensics for Time Travelers\n\nFORENSICS FOR TIME TRAVELERS\n\nThree hours later, Marigold sits upright on the couch at Sarah’s office. She’s dressed in yesterday’s clothes, feeling every bit the need to go home, take a long shower, climb into bed, and watch game shows until she drifts asleep. But she can’t do that. Because there are two people before her who have brought her back to where she blacked out and hit her head, one of them a federal agent and the other the therapist who’s been treating her, and both of them have spoken to her like her life is in jeopardy. Two people she regarded as professionals—even allies—as recently as yesterday. But today, here and now, Marigold wonders why they look upon her not as a patient with a disorder, but as something closer to a magical weapon.\n\n“Repeating what you said earlier, just so we’re all clear. You want to regress me again, to uncover why I collapsed yesterday.”\n\nSarah nods. “For starters. But I have a theory that, if it proves right, we can cure your condition for good. No more blackouts, no more night terrors or missing time. But first we need more information.”\n\nGrant adds at the end, “And we need it now.”\n\nMarigold’s attention flits from Sarah to Grant. “All right. But only if you give me more information first.”\n\nSarah and Grant glance at each other.\n\nSarah asks cautiously, “What kind of information?”\n\n“You haven’t been telling me the whole truth. About my past life. Brian. Sarah, when I asked you last week what Brian’s surname was, you said you didn’t know, but you looked down and to the left when you answered me, suggesting you lied. And now you’re here again with the man from Homeland Security in the room. Clearly there is much more at work. So. I deserve to know what’s going on.”\n\nGrant tenses. He opens his mouth to start in with the agency speak he’s been trained to rattle off whenever an interviewee clamors for leverage.\n\nBut before he can get a word out, Sarah steps forward and responds, “Of course, Marigold. You deserve that.”\n\nGrant then wheels around to argue with Sarah, but he sees how genuinely she cares for Marigold, and how much withholding information from her client has been weighing on Sarah. That sense of relief in telling the truth strikes a chord in Grant’s heart. She is a good soul, even if she believes in the strangest things.\n\nSarah continues, “I have insulated you from some rather mind-bending aspects of your life as Brian not out of deceit or malice, but because it felt—for lack of a better word—dangerous for you to know about it in your conscious mind as Marigold.”\n\n“What does that mean?”\n\nGrant sits down heavily in one of the office chairs. “Oh, boy.”\n\n* * *\n\n“He’s alive right now? And he’s around my age?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nMarigold stares at the ceiling for a long moment. Grant and Sarah anxiously await some other response from her.\n\nAfter what seems like an agonizing silence, Marigold simply replies, “Huh.”\n\nSarah leans forward in her seat. “You must understand how delicate this information is. If you were to try and contact him directly, you could potentially worsen your condition or trigger something that affects both of you. I know this is too much to put on you at once—”\n\n“No, no, it actually makes sense. Some of what I’ve been feeling, I mean. And all the weird moments I’ve had since … wow, since I can remember, actually.”\n\nGrant, ever the detective, pulls his notebook out. “Have you ever been to Denver before?”\n\n“Me? No. Well, I can say I’ve had a vague familiarity with the city. Like, I’d somehow accumulated random details over the years about it. What terminal Delta Air Lines uses at the airport. What local dives are great for drinks there. What part of town is the roughest. I couldn’t tell you where I’d picked any of that up—maybe it was some late-night TV program I’d left on after I fell asleep at home. But, yeah. This … yeah, this makes more sense.”\n\nGrant and Sarah trade looks. Both share the same thought: She’s reacting to this better than we did.\n\nMarigold continues, “So then, how do you think you can fix me?”\n\nSarah searches for a thoughtful response, tries to start her answer, but then stops herself and covers with a “Well, um…”\n\nGrant gently puts a hand on her shoulder and tells Marigold directly, “There is a chance the man whose life you have already lived was supposed to catch a murderer. For some reason, that has changed, and he doesn’t apprehend the criminal. It’s what he has been struggling with at work for the past month.”\n\nMarigold perks up. “You wouldn’t mean the copycat Ash Killer, would you?”\n\nSarah and Grant both stare slack-jawed at Marigold.\n\n“How do you know that name?” Grant asks.\n\n“I’m on Citizen Sleuth. I don’t know, I’ve just been fascinated by true crime for the past few years. For some reason the copycat case latched on to my brain and I’ve been discussing it with the community. The latest victim was found in Denver.” She looks to Sarah and adds, “It would make sense I’m taking interest in something I did in another life, no?”\n\nSarah nods, smiling in validation to Marigold. But Grant notices Sarah clenching a hand low at her side to hide her trembling nerves. This is not the therapy plan she had expected for her client today.\n\n“Well,” Marigold says, lying down on the couch, “let’s solve a murder case.”\n\n* * *\n\nThe metronome thuds like the percussive launch of massive fireworks. Marigold floats in zero gravity in a room with no perceivable ceiling, tethered to some distant source by that red ribbon.\n\n“Set yourself free now,” echoes Sarah’s voice, emanating from everywhere and nowhere.\n\nMarigold unties the ribbon and watches it slither away into the dark.\n\nThe moment she does, a warm white light undulates across her in a dancing shimmer.\n\nFacing her is a rectangle of illumination suspended in air. Marigold floats toward it. Somewhere in the distance, Sarah’s voice urges her to approach the light, but now Marigold is ahead of Sarah’s guidance. She’s done this. She’s been here.\n\nA new ribbon zigzags out of the doorway and loops around Marigold’s waist. She notices it and regards it with curiosity. Marigold wraps one hand around it and tugs, gently.\n\nThe light in the door changes its behavior in response. The turbulent glimmer of refracted sunlight on the surface of a lake dissipates, and the light calms, the light dims, the light reveals a window to another world.\n\nMarigold drifts intimately close to its surface. She can see the ribbon extend through the other side to a figure floating there. A man. She does not recognize him, but she knows his name all the same. Brian Huntley.\n\nHe turns to see her. And when she reaches through, into his life, he takes her hand and pulls her through. For a moment, she sees his face, his expression etched in worry and remorse. It makes Marigold feel like crying.\n\n* * *\n\nThe metronome thrums softly in Sarah’s office.\n\nGrant and Sarah sit forward in their chairs, staring at Marigold’s supine body on the sofa. Grant realizes he’s been holding his breath and exhales when Sarah prompts, “Have you gone through the door?”\n\nMarigold speaks with a lower, almost husky voice that suggests a cigarette habit. “Can I get a nurse to change the programming? Or just leave me the remote?”\n\nSarah speaks to Marigold in her clear, enunciated manner that feels comforting while also professional. Grant finds himself impressed with Sarah’s therapy voice; it’s better than that of most of the narrators on his meditation app.\n\n“I need you to recount for me something we visited before. Do you still recall your most memorable moment in your life?”\n\nMarigold takes a breath and moves a hand to her forehead. “The Ash Killer.”\n\n“Yes,” Sarah confirms. “Tell me about that case again. Go back to that first memory. Walk me through it, but as you do, retain a layer of detachment. This experience won’t hurt you again, won’t trip any emotional response. You’re on the other side of the glass from it now.”\n\nSomething in Grant’s mind begins repeating itself. An intrusive thought. Ask her for a therapy session. You have too much hurt locked up, and it will grow toxic if you hoard it. Grant shoves that stray thought aside.\n\nMarigold clears her throat. “I was two doors down from the first murder…”\n\n* * *\n\n“I was two doors down from the first murder, maybe an hour before the time of death, according to the coroner. Maybe that’s why the case stuck with me, despite Allen being right about sending it up to the Bureau. I felt slighted. Like this guy could’ve walked past me and an hour later stabbed a woman eight times, then smeared ash on her forehead. That got to me. Not that he would’ve known right away I was a cop—I’m not going around in uniform, and I’m not in a squad car. But the River North Art District was rather quiet that night, and I was out canvassing for any eyewitnesses in the area who could help with a transient who had been found face down in South Platte the day before. Which means I might have asked this copycat killer if he’d seen any homeless in the area, I might have had an exchange or two with the guy who kept going and maybe forty minutes later used lockpick tools to break into the victim’s apartment and wait for her in her bedroom. So, yeah, I took it personally.\n\n“You know that’s a behavior of Leonard Church, too? The original Ash Killer. The one they caught outside Detroit back in 2014. Like our River North copycat, the Ash Killer has a sort of familiarity with the homes of his victims. He knows the layout of the place. In one instance, Church knew where a gun was kept and made sure to remove the bullets from the piece before committing a double homicide. That’s odd to me, too. If he knew they had a firearm in the house, he could’ve hidden it or simply used it on his victims instead. But he chose to empty it and stalk after the husband who ran to pull it from the nightstand, only to cut him down after the Glock went click.\n\n“But that’s not what I remember most. You asked me that, at some point.\n\n“It’s the second murder that is burned into my brain.\n\n“It’s the night before Halloween, late at the desk, Allen and I have closed a hit-and-run case that had been a thorn in our sides for two weeks, and I maybe had three drinks of bourbon to celebrate the occasion, which for me is two too many. So Hutchins sees me shuffling for the door and calls over a uni named Calvin, who agrees to drive me home.\n\n“We’re on Thirty-Second when dispatch puts out an all-points from Oak Hill Apartments. Neighbor in unit 221 heard a great commotion, including screaming, and ran out to see a man jumping from the railing down to the back, and racing for the ditch. The neighbor then found a woman stabbed in her living room. With ash on her forehead.\n\n“I go from woozy to sober in two seconds and tell Calvin to put on the light show. We get there in record time, pulling up around Wadsworth, and I’m seeing the splashing from the ditch as this perp goes into the tunnel beneath us. I have him dead to rights. We cross the road, Calvin pulls over and jumps out to chase after the perp from where he entered, and I hop the fence to get down the ditch and ambush the guy as he comes out on my side.\n\n“I got my piece and my Maglite out, and I’m listening for this guy. But the splashing has gone quiet. I creep closer to the lip of the tunnel, trying not to get spotted so I still have the element of surprise, but I’m not hearing anyone scrambling on the slanted concrete on either side of the ditch, either. It’s messy, it’s filthy with mud and debris from whatever the city has thrown in since the last rain—you can’t sneak your way along this ditch. So where is he?\n\n“I’m hearing Calvin’s handset radio from the other entry to the tunnel now, so I know he clamped off that escape route. I step into view with my light on, scanning. Calvin waves at me and radios in, and I’m scanning for signs of this guy, or where he could go. No drainage tunnels. No hiding spots up under the bridge. Some concrete pillars are the only cover. But it means wading into the muck and getting my shoes ruined for it. I don’t know when to quit, and I’m not gonna leave that stone unturned, so I wade in, safety off.\n\n“Calvin sees me and slowly advances on his end, offering some flanking cover. The tunnel isn’t long, mind you. We’re under an overpass, essentially. We meet in the middle, no sign of where this guy went. Like he vanished.\n\n“That was the last time I ever got close to the copycat Ash Killer.\n\n“He went on to murder eleven more victims, over the next three years. To my knowledge, no one ever caught him.”\n\n* * *\n\nGrant scribbles madly in his notebook, seated next to Sarah.\n\nShe looks to him and waits until he’s stopped writing before she continues. When he has, Sarah turns her attention back to Marigold on the couch.\n\n“Excellent. Now, I will count back from ten. Step back, outside of time—”\n\n“Wait,” Grant whispers. Marigold’s eyebrow twitches in her trancelike state. Sarah frowns at Grant, flustered. But Grant holds up his hands in an I’m sorry gesture before quietly elaborating, “If we can get any more information about the perp…”\n\nSarah sighs. Then once more she uses her low, throaty therapist voice:\n\n“Go back to another time when the Ash Killer was in the forefront of your mind.”\n\nMarigold’s eyes flit from under their lids, as if she were in REM sleep. Then she arches her back slightly, as if in pain. Her right arm grips the side of the couch. And she lets out a long, stuttering breath.\n\nSarah watches with concern. After Marigold’s breath steadies, she asks, “Are you there?”\n\n“Yes,” says Marigold, with a softer, cracked voice.\n\n“What can you tell me about the Ash Killer now?”\n\nMarigold makes a small, anguished sound. “He … he murdered my daughter.”\n\nSarah and Grant both sit up rod straight in shock. Sarah holds out a finger at Grant—Let me handle this—and continues with Marigold.\n\n“Your daughter? When did Brian Huntley have a daughter?”\n\n“My name is Agatha Landers.”\n\nGrant and Sarah sit in quiet bewilderment. Finally, Sarah manages to regain her composure and ask, “Agatha … what is the date?”\n\n“March seventeenth, 2014. A Monday.”\n\nSarah blinks. “Agatha. Did you step through a door made of light a moment ago?”\n\n“Yes. And now I’m back with this monster.”\n\nSarah and Grant exchange looks. Grant mouths, Is this another life? Sarah nods, wide-eyed. She returns her attention to “Agatha” on the couch.\n\n“Tell me what you remember about the Ash Killer in your life. Return to the most memorable moment related to him.”\n\nMarigold frowns. The way she shifts on the couch feels alien; different. She holds one hand with the other, massaging the knuckles like she’s troubled by arthritis. “I’m speaking at Leonard Church’s sentencing…”\n\n* * *\n\n“I’m speaking at Leonard Church’s sentencing, staring into the faces of the jury—gentle folk, some with kind faces, some with dark eyes after witnessing all the crime-scene photos, the witness testimony, the murder weapons in evidence bags. The monster who took my Caroline away from me is sitting at the table for the defense, but he isn’t paying attention to me. He hasn’t paid attention the entire trial, really. Instead, as I speak to the unspeakable violence he wrought to an innocent girl on her way home from college, with cat food in her bag, Leonard Church is working a crossword puzzle tucked into a notebook. I know because for two weeks I sat directly behind him and watched him through the final arguments. Even when the jury gave their verdict, he didn’t look up from his puzzle. As if he were not a participant in this reality.\n\n“I can’t help but cry again, but they aren’t tears of despair. They are concentrated rage. Never before in my life have I wanted so much harm on another. But Leonard isn’t a person. He has no empathy, and no human scent. He smells vaguely of copper and charcoal. He must be put down.\n\n“Caroline had a bright future ahead of her. But that was just the half of it. What I read to the jury today, on a rainy Monday in Detroit, is the letter I had just written to Caroline, to explain the specifics of my last will and testament. Because two and a half weeks ago, the doctors found a tumor in my brain. I’ll be dead in a year. I was getting ready to pass the baton to my girl. She knew how to run my little flower business. And now it’s all gone. My legacy is gone. My family business is no longer a family or a business.\n\n“And all the while, the black hole in a human shell is sitting ten steps away from me, concentrating on twenty-one down and fourteen across.\n\n“I end up focusing on the bailiff. On the gun at his hip. I don’t know a thing about guns. I don’t know where the safety is, or what kind of kick it gives when your finger hugs the trigger, or how many bullets this one would have. But if I were close enough, I’d only need one.\n\n“That night, I pray, for the first time in my life. I pray that if I ever have another go at this, I’d be a cop. I’d catch the next monster.\n\n“And send them back to hell.”\n\n* * *\n\nGrant is trembling with this revelation. He’s drawn an image in his notebook similar to the one Sarah drew for him at the diner, labeling the chain of simultaneous lives: Marigold Chu, Brian Huntley, Agatha Landers. He had stared at that little graph before, but the reality hadn’t set in with him—it isn’t just one life, it’s multiple.\n\nSarah had tried to regress Marigold even further, but it wouldn’t take. She had written hastily in her curvy, looping handwriting a note to Grant as Marigold recounted her sentencing hearing as Agatha: From my experience, patients rarely can go back further than one life.\n\nSarah powers down the metronome and snaps Marigold awake. Grant watches as Sarah tends to her client like a soothing parent to a child, offering Marigold water and giving her time to acclimate to her surroundings again after an hour in a trance. Marigold accepts the water and drinks it down, but then remarks, “Weirdly, I would have said yes to a tumbler of bourbon. And I normally stick to clear liquors.” It takes both Sarah and Grant a moment to remember Brian was drinking bourbon in the Denver police station.\n\nGrant asks how Marigold feels, careful to avoid bringing up specifics for now.\n\n“Groggy. Tired, but also amped? Like I sprinted getting here. What did you learn?”\n\nSarah looks to Grant, as if for permission. Grant starts it off with “We know when the next murder is likely to happen, and maybe even where.”\n\nMarigold’s posture changes. Her whole focus is on Grant now. “Does this mean what I think it means?”\n\nGrant puts up his notebook with an air of confidence and says to no one in particular, “We’re going to find out if we can prevent a murder before it happens.”\n\nHe still doesn’t want to believe this, Sarah thinks, studying him, but he’s taking a leap of faith. So few would do that, in his shoes. I’m sure Travis wouldn’t. She feels a pang of guilt as soon as she has that thought, and covers it: I’m being unfair.\n\nMarigold stands suddenly, finds she’s rather wobbly, but steadies herself. With the same confidence as Grant, she declares, “I’m going with you.”",

      "content": "8. Before Denver\n\nBEFORE DENVER\n\n“She’s not going with me,” Grant says to Sarah over a plate of eggs and bacon. They’ve returned to the diner where they met before, as it’s close to Sarah’s office and Grant already knew what he wanted to order. Breakfast for dinner.\n\nSarah stares at him for a moment, finding the way he holds his knife both quirky and a little endearing. “I don’t think you’re going to talk her out of it, Agent Lukather.”\n\n“Grant.”\n\n“Hm?”\n\n“Really, just call me Grant. And I’m not about to put a civilian in potential danger. If this turns out to be reliable information, we’re talking about a serial killer.”\n\nSarah takes a sip of her coffee. “Okay. But she knows our detective is in Denver. She has his full name, now. And if we don’t bring her along—wait, wait, you said, ‘She’s not going with me.’ You mean going with us, right? I’m your partner on this.”\n\nGrant stops chewing. He tilts his head at Sarah. “You are a civilian. Like her.”\n\n“So? We’re special consultants, or whatever.”\n\n“Am I actually arguing with you about why it’s unwise to join me in intercepting a psychopathic murderer?”\n\nSarah sits back. “We don’t have to be all the way there. Like, at the scene of the crime or whatever. But you’ll need us both in town if anything gets weird.”\n\n“Weird how?”\n\n“I don’t know. Just weird.”\n\n“I can’t think back to a time when it wasn’t.”\n\n“Okay, then you’ll need us if it gets unpredictable. We can both stay at a hotel, but it makes sense to have us around.”\n\nGrant crinkles his brow as he eats, trying to find a hole in that logic. But he had to admit it made some sense. His fear is still, as always, that a larger grift is at work, somewhere, somehow, and that bringing Marigold and Sarah both to Denver would activate it. But for Grant to be able to finally unveil the one pulling this con, he couldn’t see any other way than to go forward with the mission as if it were real. And most of him fully believes it’s all real. What he admitted to Sarah back in the hospital remains true.\n\n“Maybe. Maybe that would work.”\n\nSarah bounces in her seat, her eyes shining. “It’ll work.”\n\nWhy is she so unbridled in her enthusiasm? he wonders with a tinge of envy. “I’ll need to go back home for two days, but then I can land in Denver by the twenty-eighth, which gives us time before the night of the Oak Hill murder. Which we will be preventing, by the way.”\n\n“How do you plan on doing that?”\n\n“I haven’t worked it out yet.” He moves his bacon to the side, quarantining it from the rest of his breakfast. Sarah notices, but returns to her line of questions.\n\n“Like, maybe, warn the victim who lives in the apartment so she isn’t home?”\n\n“The killer could be surveilling her and get spooked if she doesn’t show. We need to make sure we can still catch him at that location.”\n\n“Then do you plan on surveilling it as well and calling in when you see a shady person at her door?”\n\n“Or lying in wait and tackling him the moment he picks the lock on the door.”\n\nSarah jabs her fork in Grant’s direction, wagging her eyebrows. “Aha.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“That won’t solve the problem.”\n\n“The problem is, there’s a killer on the loose.”\n\n“The problem is, we need Brian Huntley to catch him. Otherwise Marigold may have these psychological problems for the rest of her life.”\n\nGrant gives Sarah a look: Seriously? She gives him a look right back: Yes, seriously.\n\n“We are catching a serial murderer. If your patient is inconvenienced as a result, that’s rough. But it’s not my job.”\n\n“It is my job, though,” Sarah reminds him. “Come on, we can figure this out. There is a way we can both get what we need.”\n\n“This is more my lane, Sarah.”\n\n“You don’t think I had to take a year of criminology to get my degree?”\n\n“No. What? No. Wait, did you?”\n\nSarah puts her fork down and launches into her dissertation. “You need to catch the new Ash Killer in the window where he’s entered the apartment but before he’s murdered his latest victim. But also you need to make enough noise that the neighbor calls the police. That way, Brian shows up at the scene. But then if you’re there, it complicates the situation, doesn’t it? You don’t know the victim, you’re just, what? Some Samaritan from out of town who happened to be right there and charged in to save a stranger? But you’ll have your name and contact information written down, and the moment Brian Huntley hears the words Predictive Analytics and puts that in context of you being at the right place at the exact right moment, you’re now pulled into it, aren’t you?”\n\nGrant grows heavier the longer Sarah talks. By the time she finishes, he’s holding his head up with his fists, his elbows planted on the table.\n\n“Okay. So you have a decent grasp of the situation.”\n\nSarah grins. “Are you pouting?”\n\n“I don’t pout.”\n\n“Of course not. My mistake. Are you going to eat your bacon?” Her fork hovers over his plate. Grant surrenders a slice to her, sliding it closer to her side.\n\n“All right. So we meet in Denver in two days. We can take a look at the location early. I want to do more research on”—he consults his notebook—“Oak Hill Apartments, the location of the next murder. See if I can drum up any tip that would shine a light on its significance to the killer. It would help if we had the victim’s name, but I’ll take what I can get.”\n\n“I’ll let Marigold know.”\n\n“And your fiancé. He’s in the district attorney’s office, right?”\n\nSarah looks at him with a guardedness. “Yes. But I didn’t tell you that about him when this topic came up last time.”\n\n“I did some basic research. That’s part of my job, you know.” Grant dabs his other strip of bacon with a paper towel and puts it on Sarah’s plate. Before she can thank him, he continues, “You’ve been engaged for how long?”\n\n“About a year.”\n\n“When is the wedding?”\n\n“We haven’t set a date.”\n\n“Oh?”\n\n“Waiting for the right time. His career is blowing up, in a good way, and mine is unstable—the word my mom loves to use—so. You know.”\n\nGrant sees the body language change with Sarah. The defensive position her arms and shoulders form. Her aversion to making eye contact with him now, whereas moments before she wouldn’t take her eyes off him. This is a woman who’s been having doubts for some time, and talking about it is tripping all the wires in her head.\n\n“Of course. I get it.”\n\n“Were you ever that close with anyone?”\n\n“Engaged? No. Never got that far.”\n\n“No?”\n\nNow it’s Grant’s turn to close up. He can feel his own shoulders mirroring hers. “Nope,” he says quietly.\n\n* * *\n\nTucked in bed, Marigold stares at the image on her laptop screen.\n\nIt’s a photo on a wedding photographer’s website, in the portfolio of images showcasing their work. Under a decorated gazebo, Brian Huntley smiles brightly for the camera, holding his bride, Luda, close to him. She beams with joy in a vintage backless gown. They’re in love.\n\nMarigold is mesmerized. She touches the screen, her fingertips resting on Brian’s vest.\n\n“This is me.”\n\nHearing herself say it sends a shiver through her body. It feels absurd, yet it answers so many troubling questions she’s had since well before her symptoms began.\n\nI was a man. A detective. I did this for most of my adult life. Marigold looks to the stack of books on her nightstand. Mystery novels. Various sudoku and crossword books. I carried some of that with me into this life, I suppose. The way I’m stubborn about puzzles. How I try to solve a whodunit before the author reveals it to me.\n\nMarigold’s attention shifts to the bride, Luda. Her shining smile. Her arm around Brian.\n\nI was loved. I had happiness then, in a way I haven’t found now. But is it something I’ve been craving, really? Have I been lonely?\n\nHer eyes glisten and her hand touches her chest over her heart. No, I don’t feel that pang. I feel like I’m fine until the right one comes along. I wonder, is that because I know what it’s like to find the right one?\n\nShe clicks to another browser tab, where Brian’s been briefly profiled as a detective who helped solve a rash of burglaries two years ago. With the article is another snapshot of Brian, in a raincoat at the scene of a break-in. Yellow police tape flaps out of focus close to the lens. In this moment, Brian looks stern, but not cynical. Like he’s figuring something out. Even here, you don’t carry yourself like someone who’s given up on other people, which happens to so many in your profession. But I’m so cynical. Is that what I inherited from your life?\n\nThe next browser tab displays contact information for a Denver precinct office. The name highlighted is Huntley’s. An email address and a phone number.\n\nShe looks over at her cell phone on the bed beside her. Goes to grab it. Stops herself.\n\n“Sarah was right,” she mutters. “I’m at risk with all this information now.”\n\nMarigold pushes the phone out of reach, then shuts her laptop and adjusts her pillows to lie down in her bed.\n\nA few seconds later, she sits up again and reopens the laptop.\n\n* * *\n\n“Denver?” Travis stands at the bedroom threshold, watching Sarah hastily pack too many clothes into a carry-on bag.\n\n“Yes. Just for a few days.”\n\n“What’s there that’s so urgent?”\n\nSarah holds up two dresses on hangers and tries to choose between them. “Business with a client.”\n\n“Like, a therapy client? The, uh, hypnotic thing you do?”\n\n“Yeah. I should be back by Halloween and cover the door for any kids we get.”\n\nTravis frowns. “That’s not what I’m worried about.”\n\nSarah gathers a pair of boots and tries to find a way to Tetris them in with her other clothes and accessories. “What is worrying you, then?”\n\nTravis steps to her and turns her around to face him. Sarah startles at the sudden, slightly rough touch.\n\n“You’re flying out of town with a client of yours. Someone I haven’t met. And you’re packing clothes you usually wear on our dates. How do you think I’d react?”\n\nThere was a time when Sarah would have found the words to soothe things over and let it go. But now, tonight, she’s running hot. Her head is abuzz with enormous questions about the shape of the universe and the relationship between space-time and the human soul. And her heart is elsewhere, too.\n\n“Honestly, Travis, I didn’t think you’d pay attention.”\n\n“What? Why not?”\n\n“You have trouble even saying what I do for a living. You don’t want me to talk about my career with your friends. I get that it can sound far-fetched, but this is a part of me, and every time you look to hide it away, to cover it up, I feel a sense of shame. Like you only love one side of me.”\n\nTravis steps back from her, in shock. “Sarah…”\n\n“Maybe that’s why we haven’t set a date for the wedding. Because you’re waiting to see if this is something I give up on. If I will choose to turn into someone you love more.”\n\n“That’s unfair. I don’t believe that.”\n\n“Don’t you? What is wrong with us, then? You know something is wrong with us.”\n\nTravis goes flush with heat in his face, like a volcano about to erupt. “Nothing is wrong with us!”\n\nHe stares in furious silence at Sarah for an agonizing breath. He curls his fingers into fists at his sides. All the while Sarah stands, arms crossed.\n\n“Tell me what I do for a living.”\n\n“Therapy.”\n\n“What kind?”\n\n“You, you have people talk about what they remember in their past. Whatever experiences or trauma that helps you to help them in the present.”\n\n“How far in the past?”\n\n“Sarah.”\n\n“How far?”\n\n“As far as they choose to go!”\n\n“Listen to the gymnastics you’re doing to avoid saying it.”\n\n“You’re a past-life therapist! Jeez. Are you happy?!”\n\n“Are you, Travis?”\n\n“What does that even mean?”\n\n“That means I listen to what you say. And last week you said to me, ‘I still love your mysterious answers.’”\n\n“So? I do.”\n\n“I’m not a lawyer, I don’t swim in your waters much, but let me try my best to frame it for you. The word I want you to consider is still. You still love me. Like there’s an expiration. Sand in an hourglass. Who says to their romantic partner, ‘I still love this about you,’ and means it as a term of endearment? Or when does it mean, ‘I don’t like this about you but I tolerate it.’ Or, ‘I can feel a day when this will no longer be cute.’”\n\n“I didn’t mean it that way.” But gone from Travis’s voice is the fiery conviction of his emotional truth.\n\n“Why don’t we have a wedding date yet?”\n\nTravis stammers the start of a response, but stops himself.\n\nSarah zips up her luggage and carries it past Travis for the door. Before she steps out of sight, she turns back, and a softness returns to her voice.\n\n“Think about it. When I get back, we’ll talk. Okay?”\n\n“Yeah. Okay.”\n\n“I love you, Travis. I still do.”\n\nThen she’s gone.",

      "title": "Interlude: How Sarah Never Forgot Who She Had To Be",
      "content": "Interlude: How Sarah Never Forgot Who She Had To Be\n\nINTERLUDE: HOW SARAH NEVER FORGOT WHO SHE HAD TO BE\n\nHer father shouted a lot. He broke things. TV remotes, dinner plates, dashboard controls. His temper was measured in chipped plastic and drywall holes. He never raised a hand to Sarah or her mother, and after every violent outburst he would lower his voice and declare to either of them that he wasn’t mad at her, he was just mad.\n\nIt took Sarah Newcomb twenty years and a college course on psychology to realize that didn’t matter. The human brain will perceive a threat of violence even when that violence isn’t explicitly threatening another human. Sarah grew up in a house around a man of authority and power who routinely—if unwittingly—activated her fight-or-flight adrenal glands. Her body understood hypervigilance five thousand troubled sleeps before she first encountered the term and its meaning.\n\nHer mother flinched every time something broke, but never challenged Dad. “He has his outbursts, but it’s good to live with a guard dog like him,” she once told Sarah as they hand-dried the dishes and Sarah noted how many sets had odd numbers. “I used to let him get it out of his system at this boxing gym just off campus, when we were first dating, but most of the time it would just rile him up more instead of sweat it out of him.”\n\nMom disguised her Stockholm syndrome as matronly wisdom. “The world is a hard place, and you need to find someone who will be your buffer for when it comes for you. Because you and me, Curly Hair, we’re soft.” Mom would medicate to hide her tremors when she was expecting Dad home from work on late nights. She could change topics at the dinner table so quickly it would give Sarah whiplash, all to navigate around what would otherwise raise the temperature in the room with him.\n\nWhen Sarah was eight, she found her parents’ wedding box. Someone had handmade a maple box in which all the mementos of their day lived. Sarah pored over the wedding album with a mix of awe and suspicion. Her father was smiling in every shot. Beaming, even. She had never seen him smile before—not like this.\n\nThe wedding video exaggerated it even more. He danced like he’d practiced for it. Everyone in the video shook his hand or hugged him or came in close for a selfie, and he posed with them. The casual physical contact he made with everyone astounded Sarah. A round-faced man she had never before seen told the tale of how Dad used to drive two and a half hours every weekend to see Mom when she attended graduate school in San Francisco and took his guitar to serenade her if she stayed in her room to study.\n\nThe man living in Sarah’s house was nothing like the one mythologized in this best man’s drunken speech. Her father didn’t own a guitar and never expressed a hint of musical ability. He didn’t like to drive long distances. He once scared Sarah by leaning in for a good-night kiss and never got near her again after seeing her flinch. That was the closest she’d ever experienced a kind of familial intimacy with the same man who pulled every guest into a tearful embrace on his wedding night.\n\nWhen Sarah was ten, she caught a late showing of Invasion of the Body Snatchers on cable, and it planted an idea in her head that perhaps her father had been replaced by something unexplained and foreign to this world. She didn’t believe the movie was real by any stretch, but the idea of it––of an impostor living in place of a human being––clung to her psyche. It turned her deeper into stories of the unknown and supernatural.\n\nMom latched on to this new enthusiasm of Sarah’s soon after, maybe because she’d secretly harbored a love of weird science fiction and could finally indulge in it under the cover of bonding with her daughter, or maybe because it scratched the same itch Sarah was trying to reach. Regardless, Sarah didn’t question it, and her teenage years were ironically the period in her life when she felt the most bonded with her mother, while her friends were all pushing away from their parents as hard as they could.\n\nSarah got admitted to UCLA and moved out, into a dorm that was supposed to pair her with a roommate, but her roommate instead found housing off campus, so Sarah’s first year away from home was also her first year living alone. After a week, she got so violently ill the RA drove her to the hospital. Several tests and an overnight stay later, the doctor asked gently if life at home had been difficult for her, and Sarah lied convincingly and said no, and the doctor continued as if he didn’t need her to answer him, citing that after five to seven days a body that had been producing chemicals regularly in an environment that required hypervigilance would shut down and send the whole immune system into a kind of shock. It had been documented with people who worked in extremely stressful careers and then took holiday vacations, only to succumb to illness. He diagnosed her with this same drop in her immune system, probably due to her finally not being within throwing distance of her father.\n\nSarah asked what kind of field of science studied this condition and the next day changed her minor to psychology.\n\nShe broke rules in college and drank and smoked and did all the things that had been punishable offenses while under the remote-busting iron fist of her father. Every experiment was a new expression of freedom.\n\nShe dated, too, and had her pick of sophomores in her first year. Her first boyfriends would woo her with flowers or sweets and heap praise on her and would soon after find themselves dumped. That sort of early behavior set off alarm bells in Sarah’s head. Those men could not be trusted. They started all smiles, using the word love candidly with her, but she knew it was only a matter of time before they’d turn, and she would find herself in a car one night with a pod person punching the horn and screaming at the car ahead of them.\n\nWhile the absence of her father liberated Sarah, it changed the dynamic back home with Mom. Dad had returned to his love of long-distance driving, but would venture out alone, sometimes for days at a time, skipping work. Sarah’s newfound freedom soon darkened into paranoia that one day, unprompted, he would show up at her door. He wouldn’t have to stalk her like a horror-movie monster, he could simply try to reconnect with Sarah, and the idea of her father recognizing he wasted years of their lives with his rage addiction and feebly trying to make up for lost time now that she’d escaped him … that hypothetical scenario made Sarah seethe.\n\nIn junior year she read a short story about a girl who walked home and entered her house, but the interior of the house was underwater, and her father was a shark. The girl swam inside and held her breath and lived like that for years, until one day her father ate her mother and she was put in a normal foster home where everyone breathed air. Years later, the girl dated a young man with a sparkling smile who invited her back to his apartment, and when he opened the door, the unit was underwater.\n\nThe story stayed with Sarah. It made her break up with the football player she’d been dating at the time simply because he was big and muscular and would potentially step in Dad’s way if he showed up at her dorm, but it made Sarah worry the football player was secretly a shark.\n\nMom and Dad divorced just before she graduated. Neither of them attended her commencement. Less than a year later, her father called her from a pay phone in Alaska to tell her he’d got a truck driver’s license and settled in Anchorage, where she was welcome to visit him whenever she liked. She was gracious and polite but said she didn’t know what she would do in Alaska. He tried to sell her on the idea that men outnumbered women up there by five to one. She would have no trouble finding someone there. The scenario made her go quiet for several seconds on the call, it scared her so quickly.\n\nMom tilted into a different kind of madness. Without Sarah or Dad in the house, and without a force of reason or dismissal to push back against her hobby of reading about conspiracies, she began devouring them. Talking with Mom scared Sarah, too, the rare times those talks didn’t escalate to arguments.\n\nAll of it drove her more into the world of psychology. Sarah would become the thing she needed most growing up. A therapist.\n\nAnd then a friend of hers named Madison, who was Sarah’s ride or die when it came to watching sci-fi and horror movies, joked one day after they watched Dead Again together, “You know what, I bet you’d be a champion past-life therapist. You’d love that shit.” Sarah laughed it off, finished her Corona Light, and then excused herself early. From bed that night, she spent eighty-five dollars online ordering books on past lives and hypnotherapy.\n\nWhen Sarah was in need of some legal help to establish her business, another friend referred Sarah to a “lawyer friend” who would walk her through all the paperwork for the bargain-basement fee of a home-cooked dinner, and while Sarah made it clear to everyone, including the lawyer friend, that her cooking dinner for him was not at all indicative of a date, she met him and realized he was handsome and charming and he exuded an aura of tranquility.\n\nHis name was Travis. And he was on track to work for the DA’s office.\n\nThey began dating casually.\n\nTravis never tried to sweep her off her feet or to make a big deal out of their one-month anniversary. He didn’t buy his way into her affections, he didn’t overstay his welcome, and he didn’t text her so much that it veered into desperation, like her last serious boyfriend. There was an evenness about him that felt foundational to Sarah. He took her to his apartment and she joked, “You don’t live underwater—good.” Travis didn’t understand it, but he seemed comfortable letting the comment go unexplained.\n\nSarah practiced self-therapy often enough to question her relationship. She heard herself say, “He doesn’t live in extremes. He’s not a pendulum. You don’t have to worry about broken porcelain in the kitchen sink or holes in the drywall in two years.” That felt like enough to make her happy—or at least not unhappy.\n\nIt was the absence of an emotional state. That’s what she was celebrating.",

      "content": "9. The Home Before and the Home After\n\nTHE HOME BEFORE AND THE HOME AFTER\n\nThe wildfire moved in like a storm front. Smoke temporarily hid how close it was, and how fast it moved. Then the wind changed, and the wall of fire was exposed, rushing over a grove of bear oak trees and stampeding past a row of houses.\n\nDistant sirens blared from a highway. A voice on a loudspeaker crackled, but the words were drowned out by the din of the forty-seven-mile-wide fire.\n\nThrough the kitchen window, Charlotte saw the fire encroaching from down the block. It advanced like a mounted army, pausing at the edge of the street—a natural firebreak of concrete, twenty feet wide.\n\nShe returned to her panicked packing, grabbing a box of photo albums and rushing into the garage. The doors of a sport utility vehicle hung open. In the back seat and the rear stowage, other boxes had already been stacked, topped with hastily dumped clothes.\n\nA nervous golden retriever followed Charlotte as if he were leashed to her hip. In the hollow space of the garage, he barked once.\n\n“I know, Einstein.”\n\nThe dog huffed, his attention now on the garage door. From in here, the wildfire sounded like a great tidal wave instead. A hundred yards away, homes collapsed and trees toppled, followed by the wet whoosh of the fire advancing.\n\n“You ride shotgun, c’mon.”\n\nEinstein hopped into the passenger seat as Charlotte hurried to the driver’s side.\n\nThe wildfire fed on trees in front yards. Several bowed, then fell, crashing into the lawns across the street.\n\nThe concrete firebreak held the fire back for less than a minute.\n\nPower lines sparked, snapped, and then the treated-wood poles succumbed to the blazing appetite of the enemy.\n\nIn the garage, Charlotte revved the SUV’s engine and mashed her thumb on the garage door opener. It clicked, but the door didn’t move.\n\n“No. Not now, please—”\n\nShe launched herself out the driver’s-side door and rushed to the garage door, placing her hand on the handle to pull up the roll top manually.\n\nBut snake swift, she yanked her hand away, hissing to herself. Her palm was slightly burned.\n\nUsing a mechanic’s cloth stowed in a box on a shelf, she tried again: Hefting, wincing, and at the concerned barks of Einstein in the SUV, she yanked the door up.\n\nThe wildfire was now across her street. Fifty feet away. Swallowing up the houses there.\n\nThe heat shoved her back and started to pull the breathable air from the garage.\n\nCharlotte raced back for the SUV. Climbed in. Slammed her door shut. And jammed the drive shift into reverse.\n\nThe SUV lurched back, down the driveway, and onto the burning street.\n\nCharlotte shifted into drive and stomped on the gas pedal—\n\nBut after a brief vault forward, the SUV sputtered and shut down. Its engine stalled out.\n\nThe blaze pressed closer on Charlotte’s side. Lashing at the window. The left tires started to catch fire.\n\nEvery hazard-warning light flashed on the dashboard.\n\nCrying but fighting through it, Charlotte tried to restart the engine.\n\nThe SUV didn’t respond.\n\nEinstein whimpered next to Charlotte. His eyes wide, staring at the roaring beast overtaking the street around them.\n\nThe engine finally thrummed to life again—\n\n“Yes!”\n\nAnd a tall maple tree came crashing down on the hood, spewing broken branches of fiery leaves across the vehicle.\n\nEvery tire popped, having melted.\n\nDrenched in sweat, Charlotte couldn’t find her breath anymore.\n\nThrough teary eyes, she reached down to hug the golden retriever.\n\n“I’m so sorry,” she whispered. “I know Grant loved you so much—”\n\n* * *\n\nGrant wakes once again with a start, in his car. He catches his bearings and rubs his forehead, frustrated at another restless sleep.\n\nWith a heavy trepidation unlike anything he’s shown before, he makes his way out of the car and grabs his suitcase of clothes from the back seat.\n\nBefore him stands a bland apartment building with a redbrick façade and a set of small, cramped balconies for the upstairs units.\n\nHe makes his way to building C, past a dried-out Jacuzzi fenced in with a sign on the gate in the same font used for hazard warnings: OUT OF SERVICE.\n\nThe dead bolt slides in the front door and Grant enters his one-bedroom apartment for the first time in more than a month. The living room looks more like the apartment is unoccupied, save for a dozen boxes and a leather recliner that faces the fireplace.\n\nThe place smells stale, with a faint tinge of something that had gone sour in the fridge two weeks earlier. A folding table serves as the sole furniture in the dining area, and its purpose has only been as a gathering place for mail and paperwork.\n\nGrant takes his shoes off, then wheels his bags from his car into the bedroom, where only a sleeping bag disrupts the carpet, still sporting vacuum tracks from the cleaning service prior to his moving in.\n\nHe lays out the garment bag on the floor and parks his luggage. He stares at the room for a long time, in silence. Tears threaten to blur his vision, but he wipes his face with a sleeve and finds himself chuckling. It’s the kind of laugh born of fatigue and trauma. A poor substitute for a hard cry, but it’s more emotion than he’s let seep out in a month.\n\nGrant opens the first bag and pulls out the Sig Sauer handgun. He stares at this in silence for another moment, but then moves to the bedroom closet.\n\nThere, on a shelf above the clothes rack, is a box of 45 ACP bullets.\n\nGrant sits down against a bare wall and, with the quiet patience of a toy maker, removes the Sig Sauer’s magazine to reveal it has only one bullet in the clip. One bullet at a time, he loads the weapon until ten rounds fit snugly into the magazine, then loads it back into the body of the pistol and double-checks the safety.\n\n“Now I can do some real police work, for once.”\n\nHe chuckles again, but his smile vanishes as he takes in the room around him.\n\nThe next minutes are a flurry of phone calls.\n\n“Yes, I know I’ve been at this address for two months now but I can’t remember: Do we have a laundry facility on premises?”\n\nAnd “Hey, do you deliver to Deer Park?”\n\nAnd “I just need an advance for travel expenses.”\n\nAnd half a dozen more. Locating a dry cleaner. Hiring a coworker’s son to wash the car in the morning. Opting out of TV and internet subscriptions as he sifts through mail on the folding table. Thirty minutes later, Grant eats pizza out of the box while perusing a federal database on his old, whirring Dell laptop. While negotiating with clingy cheese and hot marinara sauce, he clicks on a criminal profile for Leonard Church.\n\nOver a period of two years, he killed a dozen people in Michigan and Wisconsin. Eight of the victims were stabbed to death with carving knives from their own kitchens. Two were shot with pistols, different calibers, also taken from the victim’s house. (One stabbing victim’s husband owned a gun, but Church chose to empty its bullets and leave it in the drawer, instead of using it, which mystified detectives.) The final two victims felt as if something had altered the killer’s plan. Both were first bound and gagged, then tortured for about an hour before Church strangled them to death. With each victim, before he or she died, Church would dip his thumb in a type of ash and smear it on the victim’s head just above the nose. This ash is the one thing he brought with him to his kills. Not a weapon.\n\nThe ash was a peculiar piece of evidence to these cases. It was not taken from the remains of a human or an animal, but instead dated much, much older—one forensic scientist considered it to be possibly as old as a mineral from the Jurassic era, but he said he’d need a larger sample to study it. But this part of Church’s ritual was never found. Not at any crime scene, and not in Church’s home, his workplace, or his truck.\n\nHow Church chose his victims was also puzzling. They were unrelated to one another. They were not all women, or men, nor were they in the same age bracket. In his postsentencing session with federal agents, Church refused to explain his process or confess to his choice of victims, use of the ash, or speak to any larger set of beliefs that drove him to kill. He did say it was not political or religious. But beyond that, he remained close-lipped, which is why Church and his victims were such a subject of interest to amateur cyberdetectives.\n\nChurch worked as an internet-provider technician, which is how the FBI believes he gained entry into homes and knew the layouts. He may have entered every victim’s home before returning to commit his murders, claiming there was a technical issue with the Wi-Fi, router, or a faulty line to the house. Most residents have internet troubles at some time, and a technician on-site to fix it would typically be a welcomed guest.\n\nGrant is about to take another bite of pizza when there’s a knock at his door.\n\nSparked by paranoia from his reading material, he peers into the peephole while clutching his now fully loaded pistol. When he sees who it is, his shoulders slouch.\n\n“Emily,” Grant says a moment after opening the door.\n\nA woman with sharp features and a stripe of blue in her hair steps into the apartment. Tucked under one arm is a large, flat object the size of Grant’s pizza box, wrapped in brown paper. Grant shuts the door after her but doesn’t move to offer her a seat. Likely because there really isn’t anywhere to sit and face each other.\n\n“Grant. I didn’t think you’d ever come back home.” She takes in the interior and shakes her head. “I mean, if you can call this home?”\n\n“You have uncanny timing. I’ve been in town for two hours.”\n\n“I paid off your neighbor across the hall.”\n\n“I’m going to have a word with, uh—whoever the neighbor is—about privacy.”\n\n“How are you holding up?”\n\n“Fine.”\n\n“You don’t have to lie to me if you wanna talk.”\n\nGrant lets out a breath. “Thanks. I think.”\n\n“Who else knows our pain, is all I’m saying.”\n\n“Yeah.” He stands there by the door. “So, is that why you’re stopping by?”\n\n“Maybe?”\n\n“Do, uh, do you want to talk about it?”\n\nEmily balks at this. “Me? No. Not at all. The rest of my family won’t shut up about it. Mom has figured out how to make it all about her. Danny thinks it’s a conspiracy.”\n\n“Does that mean he’s moved on from blaming me?”\n\nEmily looks away. “I mean, no. He’s just put you as a pawn in Big Government’s plan to make people believe in climate change, or some stupid shit.”\n\n“Oh” is all Grant can muster.\n\nFeeling she’s overstayed her welcome, Emily snaps back to her purpose and hands Grant the large object wrapped in paper. “Anyway, here you go.”\n\n“What is this?”\n\n“Open it.”\n\nGrant does so, carefully.\n\nUnder the wrapper: an oil painting on linen canvas. Bucolic. A landscape of nature. One large willow tree stands before an early sun, casting shadows over a field of poppies. The painting still holds the starchy aroma of oils on cloth, and something else underneath. Honeysuckle. The blues of the sky are barely there. Something next to the tree had been started, with dark splotches and some vertical stripes, but either they’re a mistake or some abstract surrealism added to the piece.\n\nEmily sees Grant staring and offers, “She hadn’t finished it.”\n\n“I see. So why bring it to me?”\n\n“She told me it was gonna be for you.”\n\n“It was? Why?”\n\n“Did she ever talk about why she painted?”\n\n“Yeah. A little. That it was for therapy. Meditation. Sort of channeled things through her body, let her process them with art.”\n\n“Okay, that’s the marketing-copy version. But the shit she needed to process? It was dark stuff. She and I both had it rough from our stepdad, but Charlotte got the worst of it. For two years, the only colors she used were red, brown, and black. Painting after painting that looked like a tornado of blood inside a locked chest. And then you came along.”\n\n“I didn’t see any of her work from her red period.”\n\n“Because she started new colors with you around.”\n\nGrant blinks at Emily. “I see.”\n\nEmily crosses her arms. “Do you? I’m saying whatever you did, however you were to her, it helped her reconnect with her gentler side.” Watching Grant’s confusion, Emily rolls her eyes. “I’m saying she loved you.”\n\n“I loved her, too.”\n\n“I know. You wouldn’t have endured my family at her service if you hadn’t.”\n\n“So, what do I do with this?”\n\n“Whatever you want. I’m not the sentimental type, so don’t ask me. But Danny would’ve thrown it away if it stayed at the house. So.”\n\nGrant nods and tenderly sets the painting against the living room wall, as if it were thin glass. Emily opens the door and steps out as he does, nodding her farewell.\n\n“Wait, Emily. I just—”\n\n“What?”\n\nGrant’s usual stoic face and body language start to give way. An iceberg sliding into the ocean. In the light of the hall, Emily notices for the first time that Grant’s eyes are bloodshot.\n\nHe pulls her into a sudden hug, surprising Emily, who doesn’t know what to do with her arms in the embrace.\n\nIn her ear, he whispers, “Thank you.”\n\nSomething about the earnestness, and the quietness, about his response cracks a wall behind Emily’s eyes and she starts to feel the tears gather.\n\nShe hugs back, the two of them trembling together in shared, unspoken grief.\n\nEventually, she replies, just as earnestly, “Take care of yourself. For her sake.”",

      "content": "10. Ashes To Ashes\n\nASHES TO ASHES\n\nOn his drive to Denver, Grant stops at another American artist’s house, this time that of Thomas Hart Benton in Kansas City. Another name crossed off Charlotte’s list. He’s crossing the state line into Colorado when Omar returns his call.\n\n“You were intentionally vague in your email yesterday, Grant.”\n\n“I wanted you to have proper context with a call first, that’s all.”\n\n“This would be the context around bringing on board a civilian consultant to the case?”\n\n“It would, yes.”\n\n“And this civilian is also implicated in the investigation, is she not?”\n\n“If you’re talking about the nine-one-one call, then yes. But beyond that, which was a warning for something that happened, and she clearly didn’t want it to happen, I think she is merely involved in something bigger and I won’t be able to solve it without her help.”\n\nOmar exhales into the receiver. “I don’t know.”\n\n“Boss. Trust me.”\n\n“It’s not you I’m worried about.”\n\n“I’ll keep close watch on her.”\n\n“If she is the target in this weirdness, you’ll need to do more than watch her.”\n\n“I know. I will,” Grant says with a kind of conviction he hasn’t felt in a long time.\n\n“There’s a two-person card trick called the Mind Reader, and it is best used against two audience members as the marks. The way it works, the card layout is built around the ten of diamonds, and the first magician points to a specific diamond on that ten when bringing in his conspirator and asking the first question to establish the rules. It seems like an innocuous move, but he’s signaling the first card the other two have chosen from the layout. It feels like actual mind reading, particularly because the conspirator seems randomly plucked from somewhere as a passerby, but they’ve already memorized the face-down cards and just need to know where in the grid the chosen cards are, as guided by our magician and the diamonds he touches.”\n\nGrant sighs. “I get it.”\n\n“All I’m saying is, Sarah may be a fellow audience member, or she may be a conspirator. If she’s the former, you’re putting her in the crosshairs.”\n\n“I know, I know.”\n\nAfter another silence, Omar finally says, “Okay, approved. Good luck.”\n\nThree hours later, after keeping ahead of the rain to protect the newly washed sedan, Grant arrives in Denver, this time entering from the east, off Interstate 70.\n\nSarah and Marigold arrived late last night. They meet him for breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Both women are practically vibrating with excitement. Grant’s reluctance to involve the two has amplified now that they’re all in town, two days before the Ash Killer is predicted to strike again.\n\nThey order food and drink—black tea for Sarah, coffee for Grant, water for Marigold, who woke early and already went to Starbucks—and the trio discuss their plan for the next forty-eight hours.\n\n“We need a clear sense of the apartment building and the surrounding area. I’m particularly interested in the ditch, around where it goes under Wadsworth.”\n\nThe waitress delivers their drinks, and Sarah hands Grant two packets of sweetener before adding honey to her tea. “Right. But he may only escape that way after he’s killed the next victim. And we want to stop him before then, yes?”\n\n“Of course. But this may be an escape route he has plotted in advance, and if he evades me at the apartment building and flees on foot, odds are he will go where he’s rehearsed. So I want to know how to intercept him.”\n\nMarigold plunges a straw into her oversize water glass and sips as she watches her therapist and a federal agent talk this through.\n\n“So, how do we do this? I can go with you and scope out the location, right?” Sarah asks.\n\n“We agreed you’d stay at the hotel.”\n\n“On the night of the murder, sure, but what’s the harm in doing recon with you?”\n\n“You’ll draw too much attention.”\n\n“I can be inconspicuous!”\n\n“You cannot.”\n\n“Come onnnnn, please please.”\n\n“What are you, a child?”\n\n“I didn’t endure an hour of turbulence—which I hate, by the way—just to be in quarantine the whole time.”\n\nGrant smiles, briefly. Then, self-conscious about it, he puts on his stoic front again. “I guess you could check out Oak Hill and the surrounding area with me.”\n\n“Yes! I’ll be good, I promise. Do I get, like, a federal deputy badge? No, never mind, that’s too far, forget I asked.”\n\n“We don’t have the name of the victim. We have the apartment number of the neighbor who will call it in on the night, but that leaves us with other holes in our information.”\n\nMarigold raises her hand like she’s in class.\n\nBoth Sarah and Grant do a double take at her. Grant crooks an eyebrow. “Yes, Marigold?”\n\n“Do you want me to go under again? Maybe I can tell you more about it as Brian.”\n\nSarah and Grant speak at the same time: “No.” “Yes.”\n\nSarah snaps her attention back to Grant. “Wait, why are you saying yes?”\n\n“Any other details would help. Especially now that we’re here.”\n\n“Marigold has been hospitalized once already. I want us to lean on her only when it’s absolutely necessary. Poking around the event that Brian claims is the most memorable of his entire life is dangerous.”\n\n“But it hasn’t happened yet,” Grant counters. “She should be fine, right? We aren’t interfering in Brian’s life, just getting more information. Names, times, addresses—we didn’t get the name of this next victim the last time, for example. Only the apartment complex and the name and number of the neighbor who called it in. We need more. If we have a camera with a clear snapshot of the future, let’s zoom in on this.”\n\n“I’m not going to just volunteer Marigold every time you want a Q and A with a cop.”\n\nMarigold slowly raises her hand again. “Put me in, coach.”\n\n“See? She’s ready to go. And it will help. C’mon,” Grant says, almost mimicking Sarah’s tone. He smiles again, and hides it just as quickly. Their breakfast arrives, and Grant casually lifts his bacon slices with a fork and knife over to Sarah’s plate as he continues.\n\n“We identify this victim ahead of time, so we know where exactly she lives. Even then, it’s tricky. If we stop our killer before the break-in, there are no criminal charges to arrest him on, and it hangs on whether or not he has the ash in his possession in order to link him to the previous murder. Otherwise, he’ll walk. Brian won’t be able to make a case against him.”\n\nSarah nods along like she’s already thought of this. “We have to play it dangerously close to the act. Wait for him to break in, so he’s caught committing a crime, but then stop him before he stabs the woman. Right?”\n\nGrant lets out a slow breath of resignation. “Yes.”\n\n“And if you have any active involvement in catching him, is that going to make things messy for you?”\n\n“Yes. Actually, none of us can appear to be actively involved. We have to corral the killer right into the path of Brian, without being placed at the scene. If we’re discovered to be there, it opens up a secondary investigation into both of you.”\n\n“Why is that?” Marigold asks.\n\n“Because this is still a federal case, even through my forgotten division of Homeland Security, and as such, my superior is aware of you. He knows I’m working with you in Denver.”\n\nSarah follows with “So won’t he be a little weirded out if this copycat killer is arrested while we happen to be in town?”\n\nGrant shrugs at first, but then shakes his head. “I don’t believe so. Here’s why: He is a true skeptic at heart. As long as none of us are physically placed at the scene of the killer’s capture, I can go back to D.C. and tell him we weren’t involved, and whatever lead we were following, mystical or not, evaporated as soon as the killer was caught. He will buy that. He and I have both investigated cases where an individual claimed a vague foreknowledge of something but only got as close as a hundred-mile radius.”\n\nMarigold crooks an eyebrow at Grant. “Isn’t that still pretty close?”\n\n“Not really.”\n\nMarigold presses Grant, “Okay, but why is it such a big deal if Sarah or I am there at the scene? We are the ones who made this whole thing happen, right?”\n\nGrant takes a breath. “Yes. But—if you are discovered, then the dominoes start to fall on my side of things. First the local authorities would interview you about your special connection. And as soon as the simultaneous-lives phenomenon is entered into the system, it’s flagged. My boss would be looped in but also the FBI. And then you have people with greater security clearance and their own agenda coming to talk to the both of you. They’ll put you under. And then the federal government gets involved in tampering with the future.”\n\nA long silence stretches among the three of them.\n\nFinally, Marigold just mutters, “Oh.”\n\nGrant nods: Yeah, oh.\n\nSarah pulls them back to the issue at hand. “So for this to work, we have to stop the killer in a slim window of time and drive him right to Brian so the right person catches him, all the while keeping the three of us out of the spotlight.”\n\nGrant chews a mouthful of his English muffin to stall for time. But Sarah and Marigold both wait him out, their gaze boring into Grant.\n\n“Those are the circumstances, yeah.”\n\nHe might as well be holding up a white flag to Sarah, who smiles proudly at him as if to say, See? I’m pretty smart at this.\n\nMarigold clears her throat. “Forgive me, but that sounds like you’ll still need our help.”\n\n“How so?”\n\nShe elaborates. One person against one killer, even someone trained and capable like Grant, is still a risky scenario in the field. For it to have a better chance at success, he will need them in the area, either helping to sheepdog the killer toward the cops, or to act as eyes and ears in helpful vantage points so he isn’t lost in the woods. Because by all counts, this is the one chance they have to catch this murderer. Beyond the night of October 30, they have no other leads, no details of future kills … nothing.\n\nThis isn’t a request to be put within stabbing range of a serial killer, Marigold clarifies, to much vigorous nodding from Sarah. But if Grant really cannot be recognized as a participant in aiding the capture of the killer, he’ll have to rely more on the only other people in the world who know what’s going to happen.\n\nGrant concedes all of Marigold’s points, but reminds them both, “You aren’t in law enforcement. You’re civilians. I’m already overexposed by bringing you this far. If anything were to happen to you here in Denver, at the bare minimum I’d lose my job. I’d be blacklisted from working in the field. Most likely, I’d be charged. And my kind don’t fare well in prison.”\n\nMarigold is now the excited one, her eyes lighting up. “Then our best bet is to approach Brian ahead of time and tell him everything we know.”\n\nSarah doesn’t have a compelling argument against this yet, but her face showcases her worry about involving Marigold’s previous life so directly.\n\n“I don’t like pulling him in for three reasons,” Grant says. “First, and I’m aware I’m the only one at the table still considering this possibility, but if this is an elaborate con, then its target is most likely Detective Huntley, and the setup would be to involve him early. Any variant of a grift like Thai gems, where an unsuspecting party is convinced of something preposterous, typically by another mark involved, could be what is happening here.”\n\nSarah groans and rolls her eyes. Marigold doesn’t take offense, but urges Grant on: “That’s one reason.”\n\n“Second, I really don’t know what any of us could say that would convince him of this. Marigold, you have the most comprehensive information about this man, but let me tell you who is the most unlikely to accept that you were them in a previous life and you know how and when they die: a cop. We have terrible odds at recruiting Brian, and a million ways it could go wrong. If I were him, I’d likely just throw us in a cell until Halloween to make sure we weren’t trying to pull off something the night before.”\n\n“Okay, fair point,” Sarah confesses. “What’s your third reason?”\n\n“We’re back to the point I was making about handing over this phenomenon to law enforcement. If he goes along with it, and we pull it off together—if he catches the killer thanks to our lens into his future, the both of you will eventually be turned into lab rats, or worse.”\n\nSarah counters, “Or maybe he’ll be like you and want to keep this secret. Maybe?”\n\nGrant sighs. “Think about this. About what we’re entertaining, here. This would be the most valuable, and also the most dangerous, revelation in the world. It could topple global powers. Rewrite history in real time. I’ve read enough time-travel stories to know the magnitude of something like this when weaponized. It wouldn’t even have to be a government power. A private corporation could reshape the economy, for starters, and our only indicator something’s wrong would be a lot more people would develop the symptoms Marigold has.”\n\nThe table goes quiet again. Grant finishes his breakfast, watching Marigold and Sarah try to navigate through various options in their heads, looking for a path that protects them but also involves Brian.\n\n“Sarah, there’s something I’ve thought about asking you,” Grant says, “but early on I didn’t care that much to hear the answer, and now I’m maybe too nervous. I haven’t even gotten the courage to look it up myself.”\n\n“Look what up?”\n\n“How many others out in the world are suffering the same way Marigold is? Has there been a strange eruption of cases of missing time, sleep disorders, that sort of thing?”\n\nSarah tenses. “I did do a search on a psychology network, just for relevant cases.” Her eyes flit around, as she recalls. “There were a few, but the patients and the circumstances seemed different from Marigold.”\n\n“How big was that network?”\n\nSarah is hesitant to respond. Finally: “California.”\n\n“Do you wonder what we’d learn if we tried it on a national network? A global one?”\n\nSarah pales.\n\nMarigold chimes in, “There’s more. I went to a group that met to talk about how often we all get déjà vu from random things. It’s nine of us. Like a book club. But we talk about how often life feels like we’re on a second playthrough.”\n\nGrant gathers the check and slides out of the booth. “That’s why I’m so focused on this being a con. Because if it’s real, and if it’s that big, we are all doomed.”",

      "title": "11: A Wall Between Us",
      "content": "11. A Wall Between Us\n\nA WALL BETWEEN US\n\nSarah tries four times to make it work. First, with just a white-noise generator and the curtains drawn in the hotel room. Then with a subtle strobe app she uses on her tablet, positioned on the writing desk opposite the bed. Then with the help of a binaural sound generator piped through over-ear headphones. And finally, with Grant exiled to his room, Sarah fills the bath with warm water, some snorkeling gear quickly purchased at the travel shop in the lobby, and water-insulated earbuds further protected by a shower cap, for sensory deprivation.\n\nEvery attempt fails. Marigold cannot fall into a trance.\n\nMarigold feels terrible about it. Ashamed and nervous. She’s aware that anxiety is the very thing that is contributing to her inability to succumb to the treatment she’d been able to do every other time. But she can’t help it. Each time she starts to slip into a stillness, with the world falling away, she sees Brian’s face, or a glimpse of his wife laughing at a terrible joke he just made, or hears the sound of sirens or smells blood, and it startles her back into the present. Her body spasms as if her brain were telling her she is in free fall.\n\nSarah soothes and comforts her, but there’s a tension in Sarah’s body, too. She chalks it up to the new environment and the proximity to what they all know will come soon, but she’s certain it’s affecting her ability as a therapist to put her patient into the trancelike state that allows her to regress.\n\nGrant returns with a bottle of wine from his minibar. He pours two drinks and hands the stemware to the women, suggesting this as an ancient method of relaxation the Europeans as well as his father have embraced for years. Sarah and Marigold toast and take a drink of the wine, but Sarah asks why Grant isn’t drinking, and he tells her he has to be sharp for the reconnaissance tomorrow.\n\nSarah and Marigold share a look of fresh shame—they had already agreed to go with Grant and scout the area for any important details. To be even slightly hungover won’t help him. To Grant’s dismay, his personal rule only makes them feel guilty, and they stop drinking.\n\nMarigold apologizes. Many times. “It’s like there’s a wall in my mind now. Keeping me from Brian.” Grant tells her it will be fine. They have some information already, and the greatest weapon of all: the element of surprise. If this is real, they know something the killer doesn’t. He won’t be expecting them. He shouldn’t even be expecting the place to be under surveillance. Grant can surely use this in his favor.\n\nThe three say their good nights and go their separate ways, with Marigold staying put since her room was their base of operations for the evening.\n\nGrant walks Sarah to her room, which wound up being on a completely different floor from his and Marigold’s.\n\n“Is she okay?” he asks once they’re at the elevators. “I mean, outside of everything she’s going through?”\n\n“I think so, yes, it’s just nerves,” Sarah says, grateful for his concern. “A person can become sort of attuned to the environment where they succumb to hypnosis, so I think that plus all the new excitement of being here created enough anxiety to prevent her tonight.”\n\n“Hmm. Okay.”\n\nShe can hear the doubt in his voice. “Do you think it’s something else?”\n\nGrant hesitates before answering. But she touches his shoulder and beckons with worried eyes for him to answer her.\n\n“In other predictive cases I’ve worked, this is where specific information becomes the real litmus test. Marigold’s inability to get us our victim’s name, for example. The fact we don’t know who’s in jeopardy on the thirtieth gives me pause.”\n\n“Do you still doubt this is real?”\n\n“A part of me will always keep doubting it.” He notices the look in her face and adds, “But that’s good, really. You want that. Doubt can open up new questions, new lines of exploration in a phenomenon like this.” It doesn’t quite make Sarah feel settled, so he tries, more gently, “And I don’t doubt there is something far greater at work. I’ve seen it firsthand. Coming from me, that is the biggest leap. I’m just frustrated—partly in myself, even.”\n\n“Why you?”\n\nHe winces at the confession: “Because I should’ve pressed further when I had the chance. I know you said it isn’t an interrogation when she’s regressed as Brian, but I could’ve asked even three more questions when we had her share Brian’s most memorable night.” He shrugs it off. “But, eh, we’re here now. And we do have plenty.”\n\nGrant holds the elevator door open for Sarah. They step in together.\n\n“I can make it the rest of the way. I know it’s far from where you’re staying.”\n\n“This will make me sleep better, knowing I saw you to your room. If you’ll indulge me?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\nThe elevator doors open again on Sarah’s floor and they walk for a moment in silence, as a couple holding hands passes them, dressed for a cocktail party. For some reason it brings a flush to Sarah’s cheeks and she suddenly feels like she’s in high school on the way to a dance with a boy. It takes her two breaths to banish the misplaced feeling.\n\n“Oh, this is me,” she says, waving her key card over the reader. The door clicks unlocked and she puts her hand on the handle, facing him to say good night.\n\nGrant blurts out, “I’m an only child.”\n\nThe way he says it sounds like a kind of confession, and it throws Sarah off guard. “What?”\n\n“My parents both worked, I spent a lot of time alone at home. I excelled in school, which put me in smaller and smaller classrooms, until I was around kids a year older than me, who had no interest in getting to know me.”\n\n“Oh, wow. Grant. That must’ve been lonely, no?”\n\nGrant shrugs. “I’m not sharing it for that. I just…” She watches him struggle to find the words and realizes that, up until now, she’s never seen him fumbling to articulate his thoughts. Even when faced with the mind-boggling concept of simultaneous lives that allows them to foretell future events, he kept such an even keel about him. But suddenly, in this quiet carpeted hall at her door, he looks like a vulnerable kid. “I just am not good at asking for help. So. I want to thank you. For helping me.”\n\nSarah starts to feel that flush in her cheeks again. “Grant. You aren’t alone in this.” She smiles. “Before you showed up, I was super-lonely, feeling like the only person in the world who knew this crazy secret. I needed your help just as much.”\n\nHe gazes at her as she speaks to him. She watches his eyes focusing on hers, like he’s reading her to know if she’s telling the truth. His expression softens, and as he starts to reply, her phone dings loudly in her hand, startling them both.\n\n“I’m so sorry, ha. I thought it was on vibrate.”\n\nShe glances at her lock screen, but it tips enough in her hand for Grant to notice the name TRAVIS on the message notification. “Your fiancé?”\n\n“Yup.” She nods.\n\nSilence stretches for a moment, but she sees Grant’s mouth form words he vetoes before they’re uttered. Finally, he says, “Cherish that,” on the verge of a whisper. She watches him march off, out of view, and she slips into her room.\n\n* * *\n\nSarah is at first angry at Travis, for no good reason. To be angry at a text message interrupting a quiet moment with another man, that’s shameful and she knows it. She had started down a path of possibility, but a new relationship couldn’t begin while she was still engaged, and there’s no sign Grant thinks of her as anything other than a professional consultant. She would have to break up with Travis and make it clear she’s single before she could get a real sense of Grant’s opinion of her, and Sarah wouldn’t entertain such a drastic measure as that.\n\nShe thinks, Would I? Then: No.\n\nThen: Well, being around Grant feels different, doesn’t it?\n\nSarah sighs to herself and opens the messaging app.\n\nTravis has written nothing more than this: June 21.\n\nSarah types back, What is this?\n\nThe ellipsis pulsates a moment, and then Travis responds, The date I want for our wedding.\n\nStaring at words she had so deeply wanted to see or hear for the last six months, Sarah sucks in a breath, and it rattles out in steps. The words still have a bite to them now, but given the fight the two had, she worries this is nothing more than a move to try to salvage the relationship. There is one way to find out.\n\nWhy June 21, though? That’s like 8 months away.\n\nThe ellipsis returns.\n\nBooking everyone and sending out all the invites takes time.\n\nThat seems like the end of it, but she notices Travis is typing again.\n\nBut mainly because it’s the longest day of the year, and I know I’ll want the day to last as long as possible when I’m with you.\n\nSarah sits down heavily on the bed, suddenly in a tornado of conflicting feelings. Recalling why she fell in love with this man, and how he’s shown love for her. Feeling guilt for anticipating or even wanting a breakup text. Worrying this doesn’t address what is still broken about their relationship, and fearing what further will break if she is brave enough to challenge him about all of his feelings regarding her.\n\nShe manages to text back, That is really lovely.\n\nTravis texts, Because I love you.\n\nSarah types her response almost by habit. She catches herself as she’s about to hit send. Stares at the words. Her inner therapist sits opposite her in the hotel room, waiting to see what she’ll do.\n\n“I’m a coward,” she whispers.\n\nI love you too.\n\n* * *\n\nGrant forces himself to return to the memories of his nightmare. The smell of the smoke, the suffocating pressure of the heat, the snapping of trees surrendering to the wildfire. And Charlotte trying desperately to save all she can of his things at the house, spending too much time there as the fire cuts off her escape routes. Was she worried she would leave behind something of deep sentimental value to me and I’d never forgive her? Was she scared to abandon the place she had just started to consider her new home, having moved in the week before? Or was it just the paralyzing fear that crept into her veins, slowing her reaction time, clouding her with indecision?\n\nHe goes from this haunted what-if analysis into the next step of his self-flagellation, listing out mentally all the things he should’ve done. I didn’t let her drive the SUV enough to be comfortable with it. The gear always stuck when shifting to reverse. She and Einstein were partners in crime, he could go to her for treats I wouldn’t give him, but she didn’t know how to read his barks. When he was distressed, versus when he was calling to direct you to something. I should’ve trained them both more before going off to Louisiana for a stupid case about a stupid church pastor claiming to see the next 9/11 act of terror. I didn’t show her where the family photo album was kept. I didn’t tell her all the photos could burn to ash as long as she got out safe and sound, as long as she was alive, the woman I loved, the first woman I knew beyond a shadow of doubt I loved. I didn’t get back there in time, driving through fire melted my two front tires and slowed me down. I should’ve tried calling before the cell towers were overloaded, before they fell like trees to the same monster that ate everything precious to me.\n\nGrant wanted it to hurt. He stood on his balcony, partly wrapped in the sheer fabric of the drapes inside the sliding door, with a tumbler of whiskey in his hand as punishment for what he had felt ten minutes earlier.\n\nThere’s a hole in my heart, and I’m just looking for any stopper to plug it.\n\nSarah’s face flashes before his eyes, and he takes a drink. She was right. I’m lonely. That is the saddest thing a person can be. I’m being unfair to any woman who simply shows some kindness to me. No one can be what Charlotte was.\n\nHis phone buzzes in his suit coat pocket, alongside his holstered Sig Sauer. Grant checks it, curious who it might be.\n\nIt’s from his boss, Omar. An emoji of a rabbit in a top hat is followed by the question Have you figured out the trick yet?\n\nUsing one thumb, Grant replies simply, Not yet.\n\nThat’s the extent of the conversation. Grant considers calling Omar and telling him everything. The Ash Killer. Marigold. Sarah. Simultaneous lives. The souls of people who know someone is breaking time, and Grant’s feeble attempt to fix it, because—why? He wants to believe someone else could fix what happened to Charlotte? Or that she could be out there in the body of another person right now, living life?\n\nBut he doesn’t respond. He finishes his punishment drink and stares at the Denver skyline in the cold October air. After a long silence, he mutters to himself the same words to mollify his grief, like a broken record, “There’s only so much you can do.”\n\nBut after a confessional moment of silence passes, he adds, “I’m a coward.”",

      "content": "12. Planning for a Different Future\n\nPLANNING FOR A DIFFERENT FUTURE\n\nOak Hill Apartments is decidedly unremarkable. The residential buildings are tucked behind a line of trees, away from the street. Grant drives the three of them onto the property, past a large wooden sign in a font that was trendy back in the 1970s. The parking lot is disjointed, with a slight angle that suggests where the drainage ditch is located long before they pull around to see it. Four different apartment buildings form a sort of L-shaped arrangement, with a small yard and a play area in the back, before the fence line.\n\nGrant notes the few vehicles parked in the lot at this hour, when most are at work. He notices the laundry hang-drying on some apartment balconies, the collection of small satellite dishes and crowded, cheap furniture clogging others. This is a lower-income neighborhood. One that would not garner a second look from passersby. One with people trying to live out their lives typically paycheck to paycheck, praying a health scare or an auto accident doesn’t immediately drive them to insurmountable debt.\n\nHe parks his sedan and the trio gets out. They’ve had a rather silent drive from the hotel, each stewing in their own thoughts and concerns, but there’s a renewed energy among them now that they’re at the location where, in less than thirty-six hours, a serial killer should appear.\n\nBefore they move for the apartments, Grant goes to the car and leans into the trunk while Sarah and Marigold exchange looks of confusion. When he emerges, he’s carrying a box with a HAPPY BIRTHDAY message and an illustration of candles on its top. It is the size and shape of a cake box. He loops an arm through a gift bag and shuts the trunk with an elbow.\n\n“All right, here we go,” Grant says casually.\n\n“Hang on, wait,” Sarah protests. “Whose birthday is it?”\n\n“No one’s. But now we look like we’re here for a party and not just snooping around.”\n\n“Where did you get this? Like, what’s inside?”\n\n“Weights. So it appears heavy.”\n\nMarigold lets out a nervous laugh, then covers her mouth. “I’m sorry. It just looks funny. I’m sorry.” But she snickers again when Sarah stifles her own laugh as they fall in behind Grant.\n\nThe four buildings have a strange numbering system to them. The first one they approach, at the lower hinge of the L-shaped formation, has four apartments on the ground floor, but the unit numbers on the door range from 131 to 134. The farthest building units start with 141, with the last numbered 144.\n\nAfter walking past each building, the number system becomes clearer, and they locate the unit Marigold-as-Brian mentioned in her last session: the neighbor, number 221.\n\n“Should we knock and say hi?” Marigold asks.\n\n“No. But I want to try next door, unit two twenty-two.”\n\nThey approach the next door, with a colorful welcome mat before it. Unit 221 is at one end of the building, meaning logically its neighbor would be this one.\n\nGrant knocks.\n\nNo one answers.\n\n“Probably at work,” Sarah offers.\n\nGrant waits another minute, then marches back for the sedan. The women follow, looking around at the rest of the complex.\n\n“So are we leaving?”\n\n“Nope. We need to see who’s paying attention to us, first.”\n\nThey return to the sedan, where they climb in and sit in the quiet car. Grant makes no move to start the engine. He scans the buildings, the balconies and windows, the cars in the lot. Sarah and Marigold do the same—at first quietly, then Sarah asks for help.\n\n“Anything in particular we should look for?”\n\n“Whatever piques your curiosity.”\n\nDisappointingly for Sarah and Marigold, nothing does.\n\n“What now?”\n\n“No one is watching us, so we sit tight.”\n\n* * *\n\nThe day crawls by, each hour feeling longer than the one that preceded it. Oak Hill Apartments sees a typical amount of activity for a weekday. The postman brings parcels and junk mail, but only ventures as far as the mail room in a separate building with a laundry facility, near the elbow of the L-shaped residential buildings. Furniture movers arrive with a mattress for a resident on the second floor of another building—Marigold counts and concludes he lives in 213—and the two movers plus the man all attempt to heft the mattress up to the balcony and through the sliding doors. It takes them several tries. Watching the comedy play out, Sarah makes up dialogue between the movers and the resident:\n\n“No, no, your left! Hold it there! Why is it bowing? Did you get an extra-soft mattress, sir? This thing is a wet noodle!”\n\nMarigold laughs, but keeps trying to suppress it, which just makes it more of a nasal hiccup that sounds silly, causing Sarah to laugh. Grant scowls at them and holds up a finger over his lips, but then looks away to hide his grin.\n\nSarah slips out on a reconnaissance mission to find a public bathroom, and returns with her findings. Grant walks them through the basics of how to present as someone who belongs here in case anyone is approached on future bathroom breaks. Sarah rolls her eyes at his advice, but Marigold nods along with a serious face.\n\nFour residents come home for lunch. A technician from a satellite-TV company arrives for one resident and installs a dish on their third-floor balcony railing, facing the parking lot. The Amazon delivery van pulls up, and its driver loads up small boxes to drop at several doorsteps, taking a photo each time he completes a delivery.\n\nLunch break comes and goes. Sarah and Marigold both get hungry and mention taking a break for food. Grant tells them about the merits of intermittent fasting. Marigold wonders aloud if they should eat the weights in the cake box. By the time the sun hangs low and residents come home from work, Sarah’s stomach is grumbling and Marigold has devoured all of the breath mints in her purse. The car smells aggressively of spearmint.\n\nAs more traffic filters in through the afternoon, Sarah notices how few people take a look around at their environment. Three people have managed to sit in a parked car in a lot for hours, and not one head has turned their way. Grant reminds her how easy it is to be in one’s own head, focused on your phone or your destination or some other distraction. “It’s the ones looking around, potentially noticing us that become persons of interest. If they’re examining their surroundings, they’re likely up to something.” Sarah counters that perhaps the killer employs Grant’s rules for presenting like he belongs here, and grins proudly when Grant clicks his tongue at her.\n\nMarigold comments on how many apartments are decorated for Halloween. Several balconies are crammed with plastic skeletons, dangling ghosts, or paper spiders suspended in fake webbing. Grant takes note in his book of the makes and models of all the cars. Sarah becomes fascinated by the way he holds his pencil, and that he’s left-handed. “Your handwriting is so neat and vertical.”\n\n“I can’t tell if that’s a compliment or not,” he says.\n\n“Nothing is a compliment right now when I’m this hungry.”\n\nWith a defeated sigh, Grant starts the car. Marigold’s face lights up with the hope of food, and of walking around afterward. “Finally,” she says.\n\n“Stakeouts are boring,” Sarah comments. But as they pull out, another car turns in, with a young woman in a nurse’s uniform behind the wheel. “Give me your notebook,” she says, holding out her hand. “I’ll jot down her license and add it to your list.”\n\nGrant grumbles but complies.\n\nSarah quickly notes the plate number as the car enters the lot. Her writing style is curvy and far messier than Grant’s lettering, but still legible.\n\n“Okay, got it.”\n\nGrant pulls onto the street and asks them, “Where do you want to go for dinner? I’ll buy.” Marigold erupts in applause and offers three options she’d already investigated with her phone, all within three miles of their location.\n\nSarah calls back in support of Marigold’s choices, but her attention never drifts from the little notebook in her hand. She turns the pages backward, seeing the previous notes Grant had written to himself. Her thumb and finger trace the pencil marks, point out the little doodles he makes next to notes when he’s clearly on a phone call. And then she finds the page from the day of his start to the whole investigation. The gas pipeline. The address in New Mexico. And then, lower on the page, her full name and number.\n\nHer attention drifts to what’s on the left-hand page. It’s largely empty, save for one question, written by a shakier hand than Grant’s usual clean lines.\n\nWhy am I still here?\n\nAnd she sees the small illustration on the same line, near the margin. A single bullet.\n\nHer eyes threaten tears. She feels it come on suddenly and fights it back, just as suddenly frustrated with her reaction.\n\nFrom the front seat, Grant extends his hand to her. “I’ll take that back.”\n\nSarah forces an ignorant smile and gives up the notebook. “Let me know if you can’t read my handwriting. Now let’s go eat.”\n\n* * *\n\nAfter dinner, the three return to their hotel rooms without much more than a “See you in the morning.” They’d spent an entire day together, trapped within the confines of Grant’s sedan, and now everyone wanted some quiet time.\n\nBut no one handles the night-before jitters well.\n\nMarigold paces in her room, staring at her phone as she crosses back and forth. She’s entered all the digits to Brian Huntley’s phone number, but she can’t get herself to make the call. She rehearses in her mind all the things she might say, all the questions she wants to ask. But when she tries any of them aloud, they sound ridiculous. “This is going to make your head spin, but I’m actually you. Or you’re me. We share a soul? I think? Don’t hang up—ugh, this is stupid.” And yet she doesn’t delete the number. She doesn’t throw her phone away.\n\nMarigold remembers Grant made it completely clear: No communication with Denver police, especially Brian. Zero digital or paper trail. But Marigold thinks, What does Grant really know about this bizarre phenomenon, anyway? Maybe pulling Brian into all of it now is the only way to catch the criminal.\n\nUnderneath that, she knows her true motive for calling. She wants to hear Brian’s voice. She wants to see if she recognizes it as some strange mirror of her own voice. Some version of herself hidden within the vibrations of this person’s vocal cords. Would he recognize her? More than that, would he trust her? And would it be more telling if he didn’t? That she doesn’t really trust herself most of the time?\n\nMarigold keeps staring at the phone. “It couldn’t hurt. Could it?”\n\n* * *\n\nGrant works with laptop and legal pad, cross-checking and tabulating. He pulls up aerial coverage of the neighborhood. Sketches out a timeline. He looks back at his notebook and does a double take at the license plate numbers scribbled on one page.\n\nSarah’s handwriting is lively and youthful. And she’s dotted the letter I with a heart, to set it apart from the numeral 1.\n\nGrant finds this frustratingly endearing.\n\nThen a brief flash of Charlotte invades his thoughts, and his smile vanishes. He returns to his planning work.\n\n* * *\n\nSarah reviews her notes of Marigold’s sessions, hoping for anything useful. The day felt like a waste. She didn’t offer any actual assistance, except for the plate number of a car at the end of six hours of sitting and adding dialogue to an overly complicated mattress move.\n\nShe considers calling Travis. She doesn’t know what she’d say, but she feels like a conversation has remained on pause for too long since she left for Denver, and without speaking over the phone about getting married their texts seem like a kind of fantasy chat. He would be home from work by now. It would be safe to call. But Sarah can’t convince herself to. If Grant doesn’t drink on the job to stay sharp, then likewise she doesn’t want to bring any emotional baggage to the scene of the ambush tomorrow.\n\nInner-therapist Sarah whispers to her from the shadows, Travis has never been comfortable with what you do. But you spent the whole day with two people who are ready to risk their lives to save someone, all based on your discovery.\n\nShe returns to her notes with renewed confidence.\n\n* * *\n\nOctober 30. The day of the murder, according to the future-past of Marigold’s previous life. Grant meets the women at the same breakfast restaurant—he believes in sticking to a ritual whenever possible—and goes over the rules of engagement and coordinating surveillance.\n\nGrant has stayed up researching as many tenants of Oak Hill as he could isolate with data from the list of license plates and registry information from federal databases. He shares a list with corresponding unit numbers by each name and their occupation. As Sarah pores over the list, her eyes go right to the highlighted name next to the unit number:\n\nBeth Somerset, #222. The one who got home just as they were leaving last night.\n\nThis is the woman in the apartment next to the neighbor who hears a commotion and sees someone leaping off the railing to run for the ditch. It’s the only real clue they have, but they’ve done as much prep work as they can. And as Grant reminds them, they simply have to be observant of any new arrivals tonight. If that’s the only thing they do, it should still be enough.\n\nBeth Somerset. If they fail tonight, she will likely die. The thought weighs heavily on Sarah now, having a real name to the victim for the first time.\n\nGrant shows on a map of the Oak Hill grounds where he’ll station himself, starting around 6:00 P.M. Since they know Brian is with a uniformed officer after a late night at the precinct, their window to spot the killer is somewhere between 10:00 P.M. and midnight. But Grant wants to get settled and stake out the building with plenty of time. See who comes home late, who has early Halloween parties, that sort of thing.\n\nMarigold is told to remain at the hotel. She argues against it. Instead, she makes her case to be a third observer at the location. After much debating won by Marigold, who makes the argument she can simply ignore them and show up on her own anyway, Grant assigns the women their posts.\n\nMarigold will rent a car and park in the lot as far back as possible to provide a wide view of building two. Further, Grant instructs her to sit in the back seat, which makes it harder for passersby to notice her. He has a set of binoculars with low-light lenses to give her a better view. She is to keep the doors locked at all times. Sarah will sit in Grant’s car across the ditch on the road overlooking the back side of the property. And Grant will loiter on the property closer to the building, so he can intercept the perp immediately. When Marigold questions how he’ll fit in, Grant tells her not to worry.\n\nThe three of them will be on a conference call once they’re in place and will keep the line open for the rest of the night. Grant has his handgun on him, but the three confirm that their aim is to funnel this killer to Brian. And to do that, once they have eyes on this man, Sarah will dial the police and alert them before he strikes, versus later with the neighbor.\n\n“I feel like we should join hands and say a team chant or something,” Sarah suggests.\n\n“We’re not doing that” is Grant’s quick reply.\n\n“It’s good for morale.” Sarah pouts.\n\nThe trio gets up and heads out together for a car rental agency. Sarah brings up the rear, whispering, “Go, Ash Catchers!”\n\n“No,” Grant says abruptly.",

      "content": "13. Two Steps Ahead\n\nTWO STEPS AHEAD, BUT ONE STEP BEHIND\n\nGrant rides with Marigold, much to her surprise. He carries a large gym bag with him. After she parks her utterly nondescript midsize Honda in the corner of the Oak Hill parking lot and then climbs into the back seat, Grant steps out, carrying the bag with him. He marches right to the laundry room, head down, like he lives there. Curious, Marigold keeps her binoculars trained on him to witness Grant put a load of jeans and sweatshirts in the washing machine and feed it a few quarters from his front pocket.\n\n“Are you seriously doing laundry?” she asks over the conference call.\n\n“Yup” comes his stoic reply.\n\nSarah pipes in, “I’m parked on the other side of the ditch on a street with a good view. There’s only one other car parked at the curb, it’s quiet. Wait—you’re doing laundry?”\n\n“Yup.”\n\nMarigold asks with a hint of annoyance, “Why?”\n\n“Nobody pays attention to someone doing laundry. Doesn’t have to be a resident. Plenty of friends come over to someone’s apartment to get laundry done if their machines are broken.” Then, as Grant settles in at a chair, watching his clothes slosh around: “And I need something clean for the ride home.”\n\nThe trio settles in for the evening, each aware of the absurdity of what they’re doing, and that it’s based on information from hypnotic-regression therapy into past lives—or rather simultaneous lives, as Sarah would correct. Grant runs through the timeline of the last two months: The Ash Killer copycat makes his first appearance in Denver with a murder in the Art District on September 2. An hour earlier, Brian was canvassing the same area and interviewing people about a separate crime there the day before, and it later gnaws at him that he might have seen or even spoken with the killer before the murder. This same night, in California, Marigold begins experiencing troubling symptoms. Night terrors, headaches, missing time. This suggests to Sarah that Brian might have gotten a better sense of the killer here, even a physical description, but something altered time to prevent that. A week later, Marigold meets with Sarah and they agree to some hypnotherapy to diagnose the issue. After two sessions with traditional hypnotherapy, having exhausted typical diagnostic tactics, Sarah gently recommends past-life therapy to Marigold, and she agrees. Two sessions later, Sarah is convinced she’s able to see into the future through Brian’s eyes. Grant joins them and they further discover a second close encounter between Brian and the Ash Killer—the one happening tonight. By all measures, this is the night the detective should actually catch the killer, but he gets away. And this is the most memorable moment in Brian’s life, suggesting the timeline breaks. Marigold’s symptoms seem anchored to the moment in Brian’s life when something deviates from her “memory” of what should happen, so everything rides on “fixing” this timeline tonight—for Marigold, and for Brian, if he’s being honest, and maybe even the world.\n\nMarigold breaks the awkward silence on the conference call with a callback joke: “Go, Team Ash Catcher!”—and the other two burst into laughter.\n\nThey spend the next four hours joking with one another and reporting on every person spotted entering the apartment complex. Sarah even once reports a sighting of a squirrel and qualifies the creature as highly suspicious. Marigold imitates Grant, reacting in a stern voice not to monopolize the call with chatter about wildlife. But then Grant himself asks, “Is the squirrel armed?” And Sarah delights in having a joke partner for her fiction about a tree rodent.\n\nThey do this to help mitigate the intensity of their anxiety. None of them know how the night will go, but none of them want to be this close to a murder—Beth Somerset’s or their own.\n\nDuring the hour starting at 7:00 P.M., several residents return home, some with take-out dinner or groceries, some burdened with bags of candy for the following night. A van blaring heavy-metal music parks dangerously close to Marigold, and the bundled-up young man with a tattoo on his neck glances at Marigold in the back seat, making her worry she’s been “made.” Grant tells her not to stress about it, but pays attention to the pair of men as they enter the complex, clocking where they go. They’re let into a unit in the last building, on the first floor.\n\nAt around 8:00 P.M., the beleaguered satellite-dish tech returns, parking a van proclaiming EXTENDED HOURS TO SERVE YOU! on the side, and carries a ladder upstairs. Another delivery driver shows up, this time in an unmarked Penske vehicle, and takes a parcel to building two on the first floor and spends too long stalking around the buildings. But he eventually sets the parcel at the door of a unit in the third building and leaves.\n\nMarigold’s car windows start to fog over from its being too hot inside, and a quiet debate erupts about what do to. If she turns on the engine and idles, it could attract too much attention. But sitting in a fogged-up car makes her surveillance impossible. After brainstorming, the trio decides that Marigold should climb back into the driver’s seat and pull away, run the block with the defroster on, and then return once the glass is clear and park where she had been before. This time, they conclude, she should crack the windows for some cross-breeze and make sure she’s bundled for the cold. Marigold reluctantly agrees, mentioning her side of things would be blind for a while.\n\nThere’s another flurry of activity closer to 9:30 P.M., with a pair of residents dressed for a costume party who stand out in the cold air for ten minutes until a rugged SUV pulls in and picks them up. Someone in unit 143 starts blaring music. Lastly, a little after 10:00 P.M., the two young men who parked the van near Marigold return.\n\nThis time, the kid who glanced at Marigold before does a double take, spying her again as he stands by the passenger door.\n\n“They see me. They’re staring.”\n\n“Don’t lose your cool,” Grant coaches. “Just look like you’re on your phone, which you are.”\n\nThe man knocks on Marigold’s rear passenger window.\n\n“Lady? You okay?”\n\nMarigold waves him off.\n\n“I can call someone for you if you want.”\n\nMarigold offers a quick smile and shakes her head. But the kid seems too curious. He calls to his friend inside the van, “Hey, Blake, that woman’s still out here.”\n\nQuietly, Marigold pleads into her call, “I’m in trouble.”\n\nGrant pauses in his third round of folding the same clothes (“laundry theater” as Sarah calls it) and steps to the door, watching the scene.\n\nMarigold leans to the window and speaks to the man. Grant hears it in his ear from her phone’s speaker: “It’s really okay, dude, I’m on a call and the only place I get good signal is in this corner.”\n\n“You live around here? I haven’t seen you before,” says Blake, the friend stepping around the back side of his truck.\n\nGrant takes two steps toward Marigold, ready to defuse, when Sarah comments from her lookout, “Satellite guy is still here, huh.”\n\nGrant freezes in his tracks. “Where?”\n\n“He was on the roof. He just climbed down to the third-floor balcony and went in.”\n\nGrant turns and starts striding for the second building.\n\n“Third floor? Which unit?” His heart kicks into gear as his pace picks up.\n\n“It’s uh, three twenty-one, I think? It’s not our girl in two twenty-two, though.”\n\nBut Grant is in a dire panic now. Furious he didn’t consider this before.\n\n“Unit three twenty-one is also a neighbor—the upstairs neighbor.” He’d been so focused on units next door, he forgot about the noisiest neighbors for any downstairs apartment.\n\n“Oh, shit,” Sarah hisses. “The light shifted inside. Something got knocked over. Grant—”\n\nGrant is on the move. His body dumps adrenaline into his system.\n\nHe takes the stairs three at a time.\n\nWhen he reaches the third floor, he hears the scream. In his lifetime, he’s heard a thousand screams. At surprise parties. At scary movies. The unbridled anguish of a grieving mother. Nothing compares to the scream of someone losing their life in a moment of bloody violence. It tickles the core of the human brain and activates chemicals long dormant.\n\nThis is what Grant hears from unit 321.\n\nAt the door, he makes a split-second decision. It violates the law and puts him immediately in the crime, but his instinct takes over, and he makes a running kick at the front door, busting the lock and forcibly breaking in.\n\nThere on the floor at the end of the hall is the woman who’d come home from lunch yesterday to let the tech inside for the install, lying in a growing pool of her own blood, gurgling wide-eyed and reaching out to Grant for salvation, for rescue, like a child clinging to a rope dangling over a chasm. The cursory information Grant had acquired about her from her license plate and online searches the night before suddenly crowds Grant’s mind, as he looks for some detail about her he missed; something that would suggest she’d be a murder target.\n\nHer name is Dana Petrucci. She works as a nurse at Intermountain hospital, divorced, no children. Her ex-husband lives in Michigan with his second wife. Dana has no criminal record, no one in her family notable either in government or business. She had a cancer scare four years ago but beat it, and per her accessible social media footprint, she’s been learning how to swim at the age of thirty-six. She’d said it was the most connected to her body she’s ever been.\n\nGrant rushes to her, reaching for her to take her outstretched hand.\n\nHer arm goes limp just before he can reach her. The lights go out behind her eyes. There, on her forehead between her eyebrows, is a smudge of gray ash.\n\nA simmering rage begins to boil inside Grant. He’s not given a second to stew in it or consider anything else because Sarah’s voice crackles in his earbud: “He’s out! Did he get past you? He just ran out the front and jumped to the second floor! Grant, talk to me!”\n\nGrant commands his body to move in pursuit. I had to have run past the killer when I charged in—was he behind me, hiding? That son of a bitch.\n\nAt the third-floor railing, Grant looks down to the back lawn and catches sight of the killer in his dark jumpsuit, fleeing for the fence line and the drainage ditch beyond. Grant hoists himself over the rail and makes the drop to the second floor, where he catches the railing there just long enough to push off and drop to the ground. It’s likely the same move the killer had made. But as he lands hard and rolls on the rough grass of the lawn, he hears the voice of the neighbor in 221 at their door. “Hey!” is shouted at Grant’s back while Grant runs after the man in the dark jumpsuit disappearing into the night ahead of him.\n\n“Call nine-one-one now,” he manages to say between breaths.\n\nTen seconds later, Grant hurdles over the chain-link fence and stumbles in the dark of the slope toward the ditch. He has too much forward motion to stop in time, sliding until he lands on his back and his feet splash into the shallow water of the ditch’s basin.\n\nGrant starts to get back on his feet when he hears it—the rush of incoming steps, half skidding on the incline. He arcs his head up to see the silhouette of the killer with a knife held high in one fist.\n\nGrant lifts up one arm protectively and feels the blade slice across the back of his wrist. Were it not for pure adrenaline and raw strength, the knife would have plunged beyond his guard into his neck.\n\nHe kicks back and causes his attacker to stumble back on the uneven ground. It gives Grant a precious breath to get on his feet and move off the ditch, farther into the shallow water where he can better see the approach of his opponent.\n\nThe steel knife shines from the distant apartment building lights behind the killer. I’ve got something stronger, thinks Grant, reaching for his Sig Sauer in its shoulder holster—only to grab air. The gun had fallen free when he crash-landed in the ditch.\n\n“You’re too fast,” the killer hisses, breathing hard.\n\nGrant doesn’t reply. Instead, without moving his head in the dark, his eyes dart around, scanning for signs of the gun in the ditch.\n\n“No one should have responded that quickly.”\n\nHe’s not talking about my reflexes, but my sudden arrival at the scene, Grant realizes. What does that mean? Had he been watching the property all night?\n\n“And yet here I am,” Grant replies, and a miracle is granted him in the glint of metal at the edge of the water. His Sig Sauer. Just a few steps away. Near the killer’s left foot.\n\nGrant feels the man’s attention dipping down at the ground—maybe he notices the weapon, maybe it’s too dark, but still—Grant takes the fraction of a second to lunge for his opponent.\n\nThe men brawl, punch, and grapple in the near dark, among mud and stone and rainwater. Grant gets clipped in the ear and cut above one eyebrow, but manages a strong punch to the kidney that forces the killer to drop his knife in the water.\n\nThey stumble back from each other. A moment of heavy breathing. Grant’s earbuds have fallen free, and from somewhere in the dirt between them, Sarah’s voice bleats, “Where are you? Did you catch the guy?”\n\nThe killer’s posture changes, hearing this.\n\n“Who are you?” he asks Grant, with the tone of a curious predator who’s been startled by a woodland creature.\n\nGrant doesn’t reply. Alarms in the back of his mind go off.\n\nBefore either man can speak again, distant sirens from Wadsworth Boulevard distract them. The police. Specifically, this should be the squad car with the uniformed officer named Calvin, and Detective Brian Huntley.\n\nThe man in the jumpsuit runs at the lip of the ditch, as quick as he is quiet. His feet lunge for sandstone and large rocks like he’d practiced this run before.\n\nGrant pursues, but through the shallow water of the basin, splashing heavily with each stride. And that’s when he realizes, Wait—the murder of the woman, the neighbor shouting at someone she saw jump off the railing, the splashing in the ditch—everything Marigold predicted would happen is happening now. Except it isn’t the killer, it’s me.\n\nAhead, the red and blue lights of a squad car pulse and flicker among the high branches of the trees along the bridge. And the Ash Killer has latched on to some rope lying along the incline, pulling himself up to the road among thick brush.\n\nGrant skids and splashes to stop his momentum, then scrambles up the muddy ditch after the man, but it’s too dark and muddy. Grant can’t find purchase. He slips and lands hard on his stomach, coating his jacket and jeans in mud.\n\nAbove, the man hefts himself over a roadside barrier and looks back down at Grant. Just before the killer disappears, he waves goodbye.\n\nSounds of someone else sliding down to the watery ditch distract Grant, and he looks over to see a uniformed officer landing with his flashlight and handgun. Grant stays prone, trying not to be seen or heard. As of now, he’s the only person at the scene anyone has witnessed.\n\nThis is the setup, the voice of doubt screams in his head. You are the mark, you’re the one who will go down for the murder of the woman, and you fell for it! Other doubts swirl in his mind—about how Marigold or Sarah could possibly orchestrate something so complicated, and to what end, about how Sarah has been genuinely invested in helping—but panic has the wheel now.\n\nThe uniformed officer’s light sweeps over the brush around Grant’s prone position, and it lingers there for a long moment.\n\n* * *\n\nSarah, still back by the apartment building, sees the man climb over the guardrail by the ditch and trot to the empty car, half a block ahead. It’s dark along this stretch of road, but she glimpses his satellite dish jumpsuit in the dome light of the car when the man steps in.\n\nWith a trembling hand, she whispers into her phone’s speaker, “It’s him, I see him—what do I do?”\n\nGrant doesn’t respond—he can’t, he’s lost his earbuds.\n\nBut Marigold does. “I heard a scuffle, and splashing. Grant isn’t responding.”\n\nSarah sees the headlights flick on and the car’s engine thrum to life. She repeats, with renewed desperation, “What do I do?!”\n\n“I don’t know!” is Marigold’s panicked reply.\n\nThe car pulls away from the curb and makes a quick U-turn at the corner, to head back for the main avenue behind Sarah.\n\nIn another few seconds, the killer will pass by Sarah’s parked car and be gone.\n\nOperating on instinct, her limbs moving snake-swift, Sarah hits the ignition, yanks Grant’s sedan into gear, and jerks the wheel hard, lurching the car right into the killer’s way.\n\nThe vehicles collide in a maelstrom of warped metal, shattered glass, and broken plastic. The sedan’s airbags plume with a cloud of thin powder, dusting Sarah’s bruised face. The horn sticks, and a long, drowning blare drowns out all else, save for the high-pitched ringing now in Sarah’s ears. It seems to happen in the blink of an eye, a stutter in time: She pulled into the road in front of the oncoming car, and now she’s blinking awake to an inflated airbag and an interior filling with smoke. The driver’s-side window has shattered and fallen out in a spiderweb of glass. She can’t see beyond the crumpled hood obscuring the windshield, and the airbag.\n\nSarah sluggishly pulls at her seat belt. It doesn’t budge. She fumbles for the button. Something has warped or jammed from the collision.\n\n“You’re with that man, aren’t you.”\n\nThe voice shocks Sarah into stillness. Turning her head, she sees the jumpsuit man at her window, grinning at her, his eyes wild. A line of blood from his scalp trails down his swollen nose. His bruised hands press against the door as he leans in closer.\n\n“Did Denver finally call the FBI? Don’t answer, I don’t really care.”\n\nSarah leans away from him, but the man reaches in with a lanky hand, for her face. Struggling to unclasp the seat belt, she turns her cheek. The man pulls her by the chin to lock eyes with him once more.\n\n“This will feel strange.”\n\nHe smears something on Sarah’s forehead.\n\nSarah grabs at his arm and reaches to wipe it off immediately with her other hand, but the killer anticipates it and grapples with her from outside the car, their bodies contorting and hands clamoring for advantage. The man finds it by pinning Sarah further with the shoulder strap of her seat belt, immobilizing her left arm. Then the airbag pops like a gunshot, and a second later Sarah sees why—the man now grips a small knife.\n\nSarah screams in panic, the sight of the blade momentarily causing her body to freeze.\n\nThe man quickly hauls back to stab Sarah in the throat, and as his arm makes its motion for her neck, the man’s body lurches sideways violently from the kinetic force of a tackle.\n\nGrant plows into the killer at a full run, slamming both of them into the rear body of the sedan before they roll to the asphalt.\n\nGrant starts to get up, but fumbles. Electric lances of pain shoot through his right leg, making him aware he’s torn something. Trying to put weight on it just amplifies the pain—he won’t be able to chase after anyone now.\n\nThe killer has similar trouble getting to his feet, clutching his ribs like at least one is broken. He wheezes and looks to Grant with those same wild eyes and angry smile. He’s backing away, out of Grant’s reach, shaking his head in disbelief. “This isn’t right,” he complains. “No, this isn’t right, it isn’t right at all.”\n\nThe jumpsuit man limps for his knife, which had skittered into the middle of the road, and Grant can feel the losing battle with this killer in the next thirty seconds, and then the man turns back for him with the renewed vigor of a hunter circling its prey, and that’s when headlights wash over his back and into Grant’s eyes. The screeching of tires heralds the sound of a car door and a voice barks at the man:\n\n“Put it down!”\n\nThe killer turns his attention to the newcomer. Stepping into the light with his gun drawn: Brian Huntley. He moves cautiously, ready to fire.\n\nThe jumpsuit man slowly raises his hands in the air.\n\n“Drop the knife,” Brian orders.\n\nThe man complies.\n\n“On your knees, hands behind your head.”\n\nWincing from his broken ribs, the man slowly gets to one knee, then both. Facing directly at Grant as he puts his hands to the back of his head.\n\nSarah joins Grant, having escaped from the car. She helps him up, but both of them are focused entirely on the arrest happening a dozen feet away.\n\n“Thank heavens you got here when you did, Detective,” Sarah offers.\n\n“Are you two okay?”\n\nGrant nods, but says nothing. Sarah gives a thumbs-up. “He hit us as I was pulling out.”\n\n“Oregon plates,” Brian comments. “You aren’t local?”\n\n“Just passing through,” Grant says, shielding his eyes from the headlights.\n\nThe jumpsuit man bristles at this. “You don’t know each other already? No. No, this is all too coincidental.”\n\nBrian yanks at the killer’s cuffed arms and starts hauling him back to the squad car. Over his shoulder he tells them, “Paramedics are on their way. Get yourselves checked out, then call me through the main line for Denver PD. Name is Huntley.”\n\nA moment of understanding seizes the jumpsuit man. As he’s pulled to the squad car, he calls back to Sarah and Grant in a voice like a hyena’s:\n\n“You can see! Can’t you?! You already knew!”\n\nGrant and Sarah stand frozen in the headlights, their bodies tensing with revelation.\n\nSarah finally whispers, “Does … does that mean he, he knows, too?”",

      "content": "Interlude: Marigold Has Known for Some Time\n\nINTERLUDE: MARIGOLD HAS KNOWN FOR SOME TIME\n\nNobody liked going to the movies with Marigold.\n\nShe didn’t use her phone during the screening, she didn’t laugh too loudly or at inappropriate moments, she didn’t chew with her mouth open or rustle candy wrappers. No, what they found so annoying was her ability to ruin the movie for her friends while they were all seeing it for the first time, purely by guessing the ending or a major plot twist.\n\nMarigold usually phrased it as a question, uncertain: “Isn’t she actually the killer, though?” Or, “But he’s actually a ghost this whole time, isn’t he?” The phrasing didn’t help. It was the spoiler incepted by her seatmates at the theater that drove them all mad. They considered her a savant at first, but later the attitude of her peers turned on her and someone devised the narrative that Marigold was learning about these movies ahead of time, through advanced reviews, or early cuts, or a source at the movie theater, to make her seem smarter than all her friends. It eventually soured relationships and cast her out from her social group in high school.\n\nBut it didn’t apply just to movies with a big twist to them. Marigold didn’t know how to describe it, either—it never felt like she outsmarted a story or caught foreshadowing better than her friends, but rather she had a growing sense of experiencing the movie before. Something said or done in the first thirty minutes of the film would trip a wire in her mind, and she knew that sense of déjà vu would start to creep in. It was typically heralded by a taste or a smell not native to her immediate environment but as if it could be: the smell of buttered popcorn, or the taste of fountain soda in the back of her mouth, or the sensation of something gummy and sweet stuck between her teeth. And then other moments in the movie would flit through her consciousness—ones that had not yet played out on the big screen before her. Mystery movies were the most pronounced, but she’d experience it with superhero films, raunchy comedies, and the occasional drama.\n\nShe stopped sharing these moments of revelation when she made new college friends. In part because she didn’t want to repeat the same mistake, but also because she didn’t understand the mechanics of it.\n\nAnd also, she hated it.\n\nFor as much as her friends got frustrated being spoiled to some aspect of the movie, Marigold was just as frustrated. She was there to be surprised like the rest of the audience.\n\nShe didn’t want to know what was going to happen.\n\nNot with something as useless to her as the plot of Fast Five.\n\nThe déjà vu effect was not consistent for her. When she found a film that didn’t trigger it, she’d be excited and relieved. In her early days of college, she learned that most independent films were new and fresh for her and began watching those to escape from the sudden, visceral realization she knew what Captain America would do that would make the crowd roar with applause, or how the Impossible Mission team would pull off a heist. She saw foreign films and festival films and documentaries.\n\nAlmost without fail, Marigold was not spoiled to them. She had found a way to prevent the phenomenon from happening.\n\nThe problem was, she couldn’t stand most of the movies she saw.\n\nShe wanted to. Marigold realized many of these were critical darlings or classics talked about in film schools. She knew she should be engrossed by them or at least appreciate them. But the truth of it was, they were just not her taste. And so she entered her adult life feeling like she was oddly cursed with something so dumb and mundane—she could not enjoy a major studio blockbuster without expecting to know how it would play out after her first few minutes watching it.\n\nSo Marigold swore off movies, the way someone gives up a food they’ve loved until they developed an allergic reaction to it.\n\nAnd then she began to notice it very rarely in other parts of her life. Nothing as profound as her movie-spoiler powers, but just as visceral. At a conference in Vegas, the ding of the elevator triggered a sudden sense of where the ballrooms were, the view of the Strip from a tenth-floor balcony, and the taste of the egg rolls at the buffet.\n\nCoca-Cola Starlight. Brand-new flavor, limited release, Marigold was at the right time and the right place to try it, only to have her mouth cry out, We’ve had it before, and hard no.\n\nWhen Marigold was thirty-six, she discovered an online community through Reddit who shared their experiences of déjà vu. Some were explainable, some were rather common, but many stories shared the same visceral reaction Marigold had with hers. This wasn’t just a strange curse over her head, it was a wider phenomenon.\n\nThis is where she first learned of the time-flip circuit experiment in quantum physics, among other wild theories. And where she discovered a support group that met in the real world, in Marigold’s home city of Los Angeles.\n\nShe sought out their next meeting.\n\nIt was at one member’s house, in Laurel Canyon. He was an orthopedic surgeon who worked at Cedars-Sinai. Marigold did some online research before committing to attending. Nine of them gathered, bringing wine, cheese plates, and finger foods.\n\nTheir ages ranged from mid-twenties to late sixties, from all walks of life. Everyone was curious to meet Marigold, with sparks in their eyes. She felt like each one eagerly shook her hand, then grew just a tiny, almost unperceptive bit disappointed. Like they had secretly hoped meeting a kindred spirit with this disorder would trigger a new déjà vu moment to cast some fresh light on things. But it did not. And the group warmed back up to Marigold right away.\n\nThe doctor grilled vegetables and burgers in his cozy back patio, where everyone gathered around an oversize picnic table. The conversation started much like a normal social, but veered quickly into the topics they discussed on the subreddit.\n\n“I sorta wonder if I’m just in a really extended version of Groundhog Day,” Adam, the pastry chef, said. Adam hadn’t been able to predict the endings of movies, but his manifestation was with food. He’d known what specific, foreign foods have tasted like before taking a bite. “Like, what if I have lived most of my life before, but something goes wrong in the future, and it sends me back to restart from when I was born? So I wouldn’t remember anything as a baby, but as I’ve gotten older, some of this seems familiar.”\n\n“Maybe the event in the future affects a bunch of us, and we’re all looping,” added Victoria, the stunt coordinator. For a while, particularly in the early 2000s, Victoria was able to listen to a debut album of a heavy-metal band, listen to the first half of a new song, and then turn it off and sing out the rest of the lyrics verbatim. It didn’t work with every metal band, and certainly not in other genres or different decades, but for a brief moment in time she was a celebrated freak show on set.\n\n“Here’s my theory,” said Lilly, a self-published author. She could foretell which books would rise to the top of the NYT bestseller list, but only in the Young Adult category. And, like many of the group in attendance, she’d experienced isolated incidents when she felt she’d been to a theme park before or knew how to ice-skate too quickly. “I think this isn’t a loop of my own life. Did any of you watch TV back when you had a cable box? Where you could get one station bleeding over into another if you fussed with the channel dial?”\n\nThe older members of the group made noises of recognition, nodding. Lilly continued, “I think my subconscious is just slightly overlapping with someone else, who’s maybe in a different time zone so occasionally she sees things before I do. But when I visit a place she’s been before, I get that channel bleed-through from her life.”\n\nMarigold sat forward, fascinated by this idea.\n\n“Just once I wish I could get my subconscious bunkmate’s number and call her up,” Lilly said, doodling in her sketchbook. “And be, like, ‘Hey, I’m gonna watch the new season of Drag Race next week. Do not watch that shit ahead of me, yo?’”\n\nThe others laughed and toasted to this idea.\n\nMarigold remained silent. This idea felt the most real of all the theories she’d heard so far.",

      "content": "14. This Doesn’t Feel like a Victory\n\nTHIS DOESN’T FEEL LIKE A VICTORY\n\nGrant wraps Sarah’s wrist in a gauze bandage, gently covering the shallow gash of a defensive wound made in her struggle with the killer in the car. On the hotel bed beside them is a plastic bag of over-the-counter first aid supplies, bottled water, and painkillers. Marigold paces nearby, chewing on a licorice stick and muttering how she could take up smoking.\n\n“I’m sorry about your car,” Sarah says to Grant with sad eyes.\n\n“I’m not mad about that,” Grant replies gruffly.\n\n“But, but you are mad, aren’t you.”\n\n“You could’ve gotten yourself killed. Of course I’m mad.” He handles her—not roughly but firmly, touching her arms, raising her blouse just enough to inspect her midsection, tilting her head to check her neck and jawline. Like an EMT looking for contusions. When his fingers reach her lower back, Sarah lets out a short, quick gasp.\n\n“Your hands are cold.”\n\n“You’re lucky it was just that cut on your arm. You could’ve—What’s this?”\n\nHe pinches the hair over her eyes and pulls some dust free. Studies it on his thumb.\n\n“Oh, right. He started to put ash on me.”\n\nGrant is on the verge of a meltdown. “Started to? Started to?! There is ash on you, Sarah! He was going to claim you as another victim!”\n\nGrant paces now, nearly colliding with Marigold, who quickly steps aside and plunks down in a chair by the minibar.\n\n“I’m okay, Grant. I stopped the bad guy, and you saved me, and Brian arrested him.” Sarah holds out her arms and wags her fingers with a little celebratory gesture. “Ta-da!”\n\nGrant looks like he’s going to be sick. “I endangered the lives of two civilians. Everything I didn’t want to happen tonight, happened. He murdered his intended victim. I was seen fleeing the crime scene. My DNA is all over the place. This is going to come back to haunt me. Maybe all of us. I don’t have a clue how to make it make sense to a homicide cop.”\n\nSarah gets up and goes to Grant. He stares at her questioningly. Sarah snaps her fingers and points to the bed where she had just been seated.\n\n“What?”\n\n“Your turn, now,” she tells him.\n\nBefore Grant knows it, he’s seated on the edge of the bed and Sarah begins using rubbing alcohol on his cracked knuckles. The wound on the back of his wrist has already been cleaned and wrapped. She returns to tending to him like he did to her.\n\n“Tsssh.”\n\n“It’ll sting just for a bit. I’m gonna put a stretch bandage over it so you don’t split it open again.”\n\nGrant lets her do it, his mind a million miles away. Marigold looks up from her licorice and notices the tension between the other two. “Hey, um, I’m gonna go get changed. I’ll come back with extra towels.” She slinks off, grabbing the bag of licorice from the bed before she goes.\n\nAfter a quiet minute, Grant says softly, “I think he knows.”\n\nSarah understands Grant is finally answering her question back at the car wreck. “About the simultaneous lives?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Is that how there is more than one Ash Killer, you think?”\n\n“I don’t know. I’m in the middle of it and I still don’t know how this works.”\n\nGrant and Sarah lock eyes. Just as softly, Sarah asks, “But he doesn’t know who we are, right?”\n\n“We caught him. Denver police aren’t going to let the man walk. But you will need to talk to Brian. You were attacked. He put ash on your forehead. Okay? That’s the first problem to solve. And it’s up to you, Sarah. Understand? Take Marigold with you, go to the precinct, and tell him the man attacked you with ash and a knife.”\n\n“Okay.” Then: “But where are you going?”\n\n“To find out just how much our killer knows.”\n\n“Grant, I don’t think Denver police are going to let you interrogate him. You were just panicking about how you were at the scene. I’m not telling you how to do your job, but I get that you’re in trouble here.”\n\nGrant flexes his forearm, testing the bandage Sarah wrapped for him. Satisfied, he grabs his coat and heads for the door. “Just stay in town. Tell Huntley how you were attacked. Get a simple and believable story as to why you’re here in Denver. Don’t hide that you’re not from here. Make him believe this was just a terrible case of wrong time, wrong place for you. Cops are quick to buy someone coincidentally falling into misfortune like this.”\n\n“Grant. I wrecked your car. It’s in impound.”\n\n“I’ll rent a car for this little trip, it’s okay.”\n\nSarah shakes her head, exasperated. “It’s not okay. They’re going to look it up and know it’s yours. I can’t give them a story that doesn’t involve you.”\n\n“I know.” He rakes one hand through his hair, considering. “I know,” he repeats.\n\nSarah watches him. Another thought enters her head, and she speaks it out before letting it sit with her.\n\n“Thank you.”\n\n“For what?”\n\n“For saving my life.” She lets out a breath that could’ve been a laugh. “That is something I never thought I’d have reason to say.” She catches him looking at her again and allows herself another moment of earnestness. “But, thank you. I was scared.”\n\n“Yeah. Me, too.” Grant settles in at the edge of the hotel bed beside her.\n\nThey both stare out the hotel room window for a quiet moment. Grant mutters under his breath, “There’s only so much you can do.”\n\nSarah overhears it. Gently, as if touching a feral animal, she puts a hand on Grant’s shoulder. “We need a story.”\n\nGrant nods. “I’m thinking.”\n\n“I think you know the most believable one,” she offers.\n\nSilence. Then: “Yes.”\n\nShe says it, realizing he won’t. “That we’re having an affair.”\n\n“Yes.” Grant can feel her looking at him, watching his face for a sense of his feelings. He looks away, worried she can see right through him. “But I don’t like that story.”\n\n“Why not? It puts the attention off your work.”\n\n“Why not?” He now turns back to her with a hurt expression. “Because it’s not fair to you, that’s why. You’re the one getting married. It would damage your relationship.”\n\n“Do you think Brian is the type to call my fiancé and rat me out here? When it has no bearing on his murder case?”\n\nGrant looks at his hands in his lap. Wanting to have any better idea than this. “Unlikely.”\n\n“Okay. So, I came here to help with Marigold’s therapy, that was my cover, but really it was to meet with you.”\n\n“Why would you bring your client out here?”\n\n“I’ve made trips before with patients who felt the need to revisit a location that was important to them, in some way. That isn’t untrue here, either. And I like to tell as much truth as possible when talking to police. Okay?”\n\nGrant flexes his hands against his sides, stretching the bandages over his knuckles. He lets out a breath. “Okay.”\n\n“So, we should get our stories right before he interviews you. Because you have to talk to him at some point, too, right?”\n\nGrant stands up and goes to the window, peering down at the parking lot. The proximity to Sarah had begun to heat up that side of his body. “Right.”\n\nSarah tilts her head. Her psychotherapist brain nudges her, and she speaks it aloud: “You’re mirroring the last word I say. Are you with me, Grant?”\n\nHe looks right at her, and all of that serious, confident, gruff persona falls away. She sees this nervous boy in a man’s body pleading with her. “I’m with you, Sarah.”\n\n“Okay. So how did we meet?”\n\n“At your office.”\n\n“Why were you at my office?”\n\n“I was referred to you by a friend. I’ve been having trouble sleeping. Recurring nightmares.”\n\nThe words come out quickly; easily. Sarah thinks, He hasn’t had a good sleep in ages.\n\nGrant continues, “I didn’t think you could help me, but your therapy proved effective.”\n\nSarah sits up. Some corner of her psyche whispers leading questions into her ear. “Okay. And so how did it start?”\n\nThe question startles Grant. He covers, frowning, “Huntley won’t dig that far.” But then, feeling that is a lie, adds, “Probably not.”\n\n“If we don’t get this easy question right, he’s going to keep digging because it will set off alarms, won’t it?”\n\nGrant nods, pained.\n\nSarah keeps talking. “So maybe I ran into you outside of the office somewhere, and we started chatting, and you opened up to me more that night than you had on the couch—”\n\n“No.”\n\nSarah’s voice hitches in her throat. She feels suddenly vulnerable, bracing for a fresh wound. “No? Why not?”\n\nGrant closes his eyes, takes a long, slow breath, and then speaks quietly but seriously. “After three sessions, I call and tell you I can’t be your client anymore—we can’t have a professional relationship. It seems out of the blue, but you’ve had your fair share of people who make inroads into therapy and then drop out when it starts to get tough. But then you’re at your favorite bar after work that week, the Bungalow, and you spy me at a couch by myself. You’re two drinks in, and so with some Dutch courage, you come up and ask me why I dropped you. Was it you? Was it your method of therapy? Was I just too comfortable with the version of myself that was broken?”\n\n“How’d you know I love the Bungalow?” is all Sarah can muster, under her breath.\n\nGrant plows on without skipping a beat. “I tell you it’s none of those things. You press me for an answer and I tell you it’s because I’d fallen in love with you. I feel terrible about it, I know you’re engaged, and I imagine you have plenty of clients fall for you because you’re empathetic, you listen not just with your head but with your heart, and you are incredibly charming.”\n\nSarah keeps her mouth shut. She holds her breath.\n\nGrant can’t stop himself now that he’s started down this path. “I could tell that the more you managed to unlock inside of me, the harder I was bound to fall for you. And I think that’s really what I need most. Beyond facing the hurt I’d hidden away, it’s to be in love again. But that’s unfair to you, so, yeah, that’s why I quit therapy.”\n\n“And I tell you I’ve fallen for you. And we go somewhere together that night.”\n\nShe says it quickly at the end of his story, surprising Grant.\n\nThey dare to make eye contact with each other, in the silence they both suffer after. But then he nods, and she nods back, and they quickly look away, aware of the charged air in the room around them.\n\n“Then I guess work takes me back East, and we stay in touch, so when you tell me of this trip with Marigold…”\n\n“You drive to Denver to see me. To make sure we’re committed to our choices. Yeah?”\n\nMore nods. “Yeah.”\n\nSarah finds she’s holding her breath again and lets it out. “Okay.”\n\nGrant hears his heart beating in his chest but dismisses it as nerves. It’s a passable story. Only Omar would question me about it, knowing my history. Why am I so nervous?\n\nHe makes for the door. “Get some sleep, then go see Brian. I’ll be back in twenty-four hours.”\n\n* * *\n\nThree hours later, at the hotel lobby, Marigold tries her best to contain her voice with Sarah. “Absolutely not. Are you out of your minds? No.”\n\nSarah stammers, “It’s to avoid having him put in the spotlight with the Denver police.”\n\nMarigold sits them both down in the lounge seating near the self-serve coffee bar. They’re both showered and dressed in fresh clothes, but still look ragged. The lobby at this early hour of the morning is empty, save for the yawning front-desk clerk on his phone.\n\n“There are plenty of other stories!” Marigold says in a harsh whisper. “I’ve been working up one all night, but did you think to ask me?”\n\n“I’m sorry, I just— Wait, you have?”\n\n“Of course!”\n\n“How will it explain Grant’s involvement?”\n\nMarigold folds her arms over her chest. “That’s easy. But you have to tell him to drop the infidelity story that could wreck your relationship and damage both your careers. Come on.”\n\nSarah nods, surrendering. “If your idea is good, yeah.”\n\n“Text him.”\n\n“I will.”\n\nMarigold exhales. “Okay. Here is the deal…”\n\n* * *\n\nAt the precinct station, Marigold watches Brian and Sarah through the glass. He chose to speak to them one at a time, starting with Sarah, whom he brought into an interview room with a glass wall, two dozen paces from his bullpen cubicle. Sarah’s face is distraught. Her arms tremble. She tries drinking the coffee Brian has brought her but clearly worries it will make her more anxious. Marigold hopes Sarah sticks to the narrative they agreed on. It’s clean, relies on Marigold to fill in the rest, and mention of Grant is minimal. It’s his car in the impound so it will come out soon, but their job for now is to make sure the killer remains behind bars.\n\n“Are you telling him you’re just friends? Or coworkers? He saw you and Grant together at the scene. You were driving at night with a man who isn’t your fiancé. Perhaps you’re leaning into that, to maybe garner some sympathy from the detective? Like he’ll think you were far from California because you’re seeing this man on the side. No wonder you’re trembling.” Marigold sighs. “You’re a great therapist, Sarah, but you’re an absolute mess.”\n\nShe wonders if Brian will be gentle with Sarah, or if he’ll call Travis and have her relay the whole story to him. It occurs to Marigold she’s wondering what another version of her would do in this situation. “He’s me,” she muses. “Would I make her confess the purpose of her trip to Denver to her boyfriend back in Santa Monica?”\n\nMarigold’s attention drifts to Brian’s desk. The photo of him and Luda next to his monitor. The mess of papers in stacks with sticky notes labeling each stack. An opened bag of potato chips from the vending machine. A dog-eared paper- back novel.\n\nOh my god, I was just reading this and stopped because it felt like I’d read it before. She thumbs through the pages with a strange sense of delight, as if solving a riddle.\n\n“Can I get you anything to drink?” Marigold looks up to see Brian’s partner, Allen, still in his coat, unraveling his scarf at the cubicle next to Brian’s. “You were at Oak Hill earlier, yeah?”\n\n“Yes, that’s right. I saw the man you have in custody. The one in the satellite dish uniform.”\n\n“Edgar Troy.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“That’s the perp. Ever heard of him? Seen him around maybe?”\n\nMarigold shakes her head.\n\nAllen shrugs. “Worth a shot. You a resident there?”\n\nI don’t want to be questioned by you. I want to see Brian. I flew here to see the man whose life I’ve already lived. “No, I was going to a party.”\n\n“A party, that sounds a lot more fun than what we’re doing now. Who was hosting?”\n\nAllen casually flips open a small notepad.\n\nOh no, you don’t, she thinks. I’m getting time with Brian whether you like it or not. Marigold puts a hand on her belly. “Actually, if you have any sort of snack? I missed dinner. Just like a sandwich and a soda? I’ll pay.”\n\nAllen holds up his hands, grinning sheepishly. “Whoa now, what kinda establishment do you think this is? Please, it’s on me. Be right back.”\n\n“Thank you, Allen.”\n\nShe swivels in her chair as she hears the interview room door open and Brian steps out with Sarah, who’s nodding along at whatever comforting words Brian is giving her. Marigold misses the look Allen gives her as he steps into the break room. She also misses what he says under his breath: “Did I introduce myself?”\n\n* * *\n\nBrian sits across from her in the quiet of the interview room. Marigold leans back in the chair Sarah had been sitting in not a minute ago.\n\nIt feels like a staring contest. Brian tilts his head at Marigold and starts, for the third time, to jot down something on his legal pad in front of him.\n\n“Have we met?” he finally asks.\n\n“Not in this life.”\n\n“You’re smiling.”\n\n“Am I?”\n\n“Marigold Chu, is it?”\n\nShe raises both hands. “You got me dead to rights.”\n\nBrian chuckles at this, finally writes on the legal pad. “Marigold, please don’t take offense to this question. Are you a little drunk right now?”\n\nMarigold blinks. Her mind takes her back to when Grant and Sarah were trying to ignore their sexual tension while doing something as blatantly intimate as dressing each other’s wounds, and why, yes, she did polish off that bottle of wine in her room after that.\n\nShe smiles some more and holds up her thumb and pointer finger: a little bit.\n\nBrian laughs again. Marigold likes the sound of it. I hope I’m a good husband, she thinks.\n\n“Well, Marigold, by all signs it seems we’ve caught a serial killer tonight, and I hope to join you in the land of the tipsy soon, if you’ll just help me with a few smaller mysteries.”\n\n“I would love to, Detective Huntley.”\n\n“Just Brian is fine.”\n\nMarigold leans in, conspiratorially. “Let’s solve some mysteries together, Brian.”\n\nBrian chuckles and shakes his head, but starts in.\n\n“So, the lady you came in with, Sarah, she’s in from LA.”\n\n“Yup.”\n\n“Same as you, I see.”\n\n“She’s my therapist.”\n\n“Do you often take vacations with your therapist?”\n\n“This is a first for me. And for her, too.”\n\nBrian tilts his head at Marigold again, and she’s aware she’s still smiling mysteriously. He clears his throat and continues.\n\n“I have a lot more questions. But first, she was with a gentleman tonight.”\n\n“Grant, yes.”\n\n“He’s not from LA, though.”\n\n“He’s from Homeland Security.”\n\nBrian raises an eyebrow at this. “He’s a Fed? Sarah didn’t mention that.”\n\n“I don’t think she wants to get him in trouble.”\n\n“Why would he be in trouble?”\n\nMarigold glances out the glass wall to see Sarah at the cubicle, staring nervously at her. Marigold nods almost imperceptibly at her as she puts her elbows on the table and looks into Brian’s eyes.\n\n“Because of me.”\n\nBrian studies her. “Why do I get the feeling you’re going to tell me something salacious?”\n\nMarigold shakes her head. “Brian, I’m going to tell you the reason why I’ve been going to therapy.”\n\n“You don’t have to be that forthcoming, Miss Chu.”\n\n“It’s because I’m a mystic.”\n\nBrian now mimics her behavior, leaning in closer. “A mystic.”\n\n“I’ve been having visions of the future.”\n\n“Uh-huh.”\n\n“And it’s all been about the Ash Killer. And you. This case.”\n\n“All the way from Los Angeles?”\n\n“I can’t explain it. But my mom swears my grandmother was psychic. So who knows?”\n\nBrian seems disappointed. “Uh-huh. So you had visions of the murder tonight.”\n\n“You know there’s a federal agency called Predictive Analytics? They look into people like me. That’s why a therapist from Santa Monica and a very gruff agent are in town with a software engineer who lives in Sherman Oaks. Because they wanted to prove I was just having weird nightmares, not prophetic dreams.”\n\nBrian puts his pen down on his legal pad. “Marigold. I’ve bumped into psychics before in this job. And I mean no offense to you, I just don’t think you could somehow pinpoint that a killer is running around several states away. I mean, the psychic who came in here had an article of clothing from a victim and had been to a crime scene, my guys in Major Crimes gave her as much as they could without violating case law, and the best she could do was talk about a white panel van and a forest. So I’m gonna say you got incredibly lucky or unlucky, depending on how you see it. And I’m also gonna need to talk to your man Grant from Predictive Analytics.”\n\nMarigold nods along, still smiling. “You’re a good cop.”\n\n“Thank you.”\n\n“I wouldn’t believe me either, if I were sitting where you are now.” Marigold stifles a little laugh like she told a joke Brian doesn’t get.\n\n“I do hope the nightmares stop now, though,” he says earnestly, and a wave of relief floods through her system. The nightmares will stop. And the headaches. I can feel that.\n\n“There has been this buzzing in my head for over a month now. But you know what? It’s gone. I don’t feel it anymore. The space-time continuum is fixed!” She hiccups.\n\n“Okay, I am going to need you to jot down whatever booze you had tonight, because I’ve gotta get me some of that.”\n\n“How about you just bring in the bourbon you were having earlier?”\n\nBrian’s smile fades. He stares at Marigold.\n\n“What?”\n\n“It’s why the uniformed cop was giving you a ride, right? What’s his name? Calvin?”\n\nBrian frowns. Looks out toward Sarah and the rest of the Homicide bullpen for a moment, as if checking to see if he’s being pranked.\n\n“Did my partner tell you about that?”\n\nMarigold leans back in her chair, arms tucked behind her head. “Few days back, did your wife’s car have a flat tire and make you late to work, or was that just another strange nightmare of mine?”\n\nBrian stands suddenly, glaring at Marigold.\n\n“Holy shit. Who are you?!”\n\n* * *\n\nThe wildfire moves in like a storm front. Smoke temporarily hides how close it is, and how fast it moves. Then the wind changes, and the wall of fire is exposed, rushing over a grove of bear oak trees and stampeding past a row of houses.\n\nDistant sirens blare from the highway. A voice on a loudspeaker crackles, but the words are drowned out by the din of the forty-seven-mile-wide fire.\n\nThrough the kitchen window, Charlotte sees the encroaching enemy from down the block. It advances like a mounted army, pausing at the edge of the street—a natural firebreak of concrete, twenty feet wide.\n\nShe returns to her panicked packing, grabbing a box of photo albums, and rushing into the garage. The doors of a sport utility vehicle hang open. In the back seat and the rear stowage, other boxes have already been stacked, topped with hastily dumped clothes.\n\nA nervous golden retriever follows Charlotte as if he were leashed to her hip. In the hollow space of the garage, he barks once.\n\n“I know, Einstein.”\n\nThe dog huffs, his attention now on the front door.\n\nA second later, there’s a knock at the door.\n\nCharlotte’s posture stiffens. “Who in the world could that be? Grant’s on a case in Texas.”\n\nEinstein huffs again, in agreement.\n\nStill feeling the urgency to finish packing and flee, Charlotte goes to the door, calling out, “Who’s there?”\n\n“Forest Ranger Sullivan O’Cooke, ma’am. Open the door?”\n\nCharlotte does so.\n\nStanding before her is a tall, toned, bearded man in full turnout gear—fire-retardant protection from helm to boot. He holds a second coat under one arm. Behind him, a rugged truck with insulated tires idles at the curb, partially on the sidewalk.\n\n“I know,” Charlotte confesses, “I’m leaving now.”\n\nThe forest ranger smiles at her, but there’s an intensity in his gaze. “Yes, you are.” He hands her the bunker coat to put on. “You and the retriever are getting into my truck right now. We have ten seconds, let’s move.”\n\nCharlotte blinks. From the deep, folded recesses of her mind, an alarm bell is ringing. Like reality has bent. This isn’t quite right, is it? Of all the doors to knock on, he knew I was here?\n\n“Please,” Sullivan insists.\n\nShe looks over her shoulder, back into the hastily packed room of boxes, and in the moment she takes her eyes off the ranger, he grabs her by the elbow and pulls her out the door.\n\n“Hey!”\n\nCharlotte reels one arm back to swing a punch, fueled by the instinct born of any woman feeling threatened, but she’s caught off guard again by Sullivan’s draping the bunker coat over her shoulders.\n\nHe calls past her, “Einstein, come!”\n\nThe dog hurries for the truck.\n\nCharlotte is momentarily gobsmacked. Before she knows it, she’s moved to the passenger door of the truck. He knows the dog’s name.\n\nWhen he climbs into the driver’s seat and buckles up, he has a fresh serenity to his demeanor. His voice no longer crackles with anxiety. He looks over at Charlotte while he puts the truck in gear, with Einstein poking his head between the front seats from the footwell of the cramped bench seat in back. “All set?”\n\nShe nods. The truck vaults forward.\n\nAs they round the corner, the fire crosses the street behind them, felling a tree as a bridge, pouring onto the lawn of Grant’s house.\n\nCharlotte can’t stop staring at Sullivan.\n\nFinally, she mutters, “Your name is O’Cooke?”\n\n“Sully is fine.”\n\n“Sully … How did you know about us? Did Grant send you?”\n\nThe ranger smiles. “That’s the simplest way to put it, yeah.”\n\nCharlotte knows that smile. The crooked dimple on one cheek … It’s so familiar to her. As she reaches out to poke Sullivan’s arm, to make sure she isn’t dreaming—\n\n* * *\n\nGrant wakes from the dream.\n\nHe holds his hands to his head for a moment, to steady his nerves. The elation of wish fulfillment and the crash of reality is too quick a change in altitude for his heart.\n\nI’m already fantasizing who I’d be, and what I’d do, if I came back, he thinks.\n\nGrant checks the hotel clock: It’s 4:15 A.M. He’s barely had two hours of sleep.\n\nHe finds his phone in the dark and awkwardly unlocks it and thumbs to the photo app without removing it from its charging cable. He finds a recent saved photo: the unfinished painting Charlotte’s sister gifted to him.\n\n“Still unfinished,” he tells himself. His notebook lies open on the bed, next to his laptop, occupying the space a lover would. He sits up, and the jostle awakens the laptop’s monitor, casting a glow over the linens.\n\nFind a constant is written on the open spread of his notebook. A short breath escapes his nostrils as the slightest form of a laugh. He’d stolen that idea from a TV series that dealt with temporal anomalies. The gist of it was, in a scenario where time could warp or break, use something or someone you know as a kind of North Star to help reaffirm your position in the world. It isn’t quite the same for Grant—here, he chose to use a reference to see if his reality changed at any point. A bit more like the McFly family photo in Back to the Future, except Grant isn’t the one doing the time traveling. He didn’t know if it would work, but it felt better than doing nothing.\n\nCharlotte is still dead. And Einstein. His house was burned to the foundation. He reverted to the robot he was before he met her.\n\nI will come back, and I’ll save her. Grant rubs his eyes to stop the tears. I don’t care who gets headaches or seizures because of it.\n\nAn insidious little idea takes hold of him. He looks past his notebook, to the unused pillow. Sliding it aside, he reveals the Sig Sauer he retrieved from the scene before anyone else could find it, freshly cleaned from the muck of the ditch.\n\nI could restart right now, couldn’t I? He touches the weapon. Holds it before him like an appraiser, feeling the heft of it. I could just undo time. Eating a bullet now wouldn’t even matter, because if I rescue her, I’ll still be happy as Grant. I’ll live on.\n\nThe weapon trembles in his hands as his arms start to shake from the reaction of such a commitment.\n\nOmar’s voice speaks as a surrogate for his doubts and his conscience. “Don’t be so willfully ignorant—what makes you think you’d remember any specifics of who you were in this life? Did Marigold? What’s to say you have control over your next life? What if you don’t get to pick when or where you’re born, or what body you occupy?”\n\nGrant squeezes his eyes shut. “I’ll figure it out.” He checks to see there’s a round in the chamber.\n\nOmar refuses to let him make the irreversible, impulsive choice, shouting in the back of Grant’s head, “You’ll be just like Marigold, with some vague sense of déjà vu when you see the news of the wildfire! Quit trying to save Charlotte and focus on saving people who need you now!”\n\nGrant stares at the handgun. “Why am I here?” he asks again, repeating what he wrote in his notebook four months ago, but this time it’s not an existential question—more spoken like a man who’s late to an important meeting.\n\nHe hears Omar kicking his chair in his office, the way he did when he was first fooled by a cold reader from a kidnapping case. “Agent Lukather! You are smarter than this! Think about it! If you were able to save her, it would have happened already! All you’d do is leave two women vulnerable here and now. Because do you know who may have figured out how to remember his other lives? A goddamn serial killer!”\n\nGrant’s eyes widen in revelation. Of course. Someone has cracked this code already.\n\nHe slides his laptop to him, and keys in his password.\n\nOn his agency’s website log-on, he enters the federal prison system database.\n\nHe mutters as he types, “Where are you being held these days, Leonard?”",

Bleary, but amped up on coffee and powdered doughnuts from a gas station, he passes through Colorado Springs, onward to Florence.\n\nFlorence, Colorado. Home to ADX. Grant had been expecting a federal prison in Michigan or somewhere farther east, but after an inmate-search query on the prison system database, he learned the truth. Leonard Church isn’t locked down in Michigan or Wisconsin. For the last four years he’s been stationed in a supermax prison for notorious murderers, barely a two-hour drive from Denver.\n\nIs that why the latest Ash Killer chose Denver? Proximity? The more Grant tries to get a mental grasp of what he and Sarah believe is happening, the less it makes sense.\n\nThe man who nearly got away with murder last night, and nearly killed Sarah, is named Edgar Troy. Grant pulled his profile from the Bureau, but it was paper-thin. No priors, at least not on the federal or state level. Beyond credit card debt and a string of unpaid parking tickets in Wisconsin and Michigan, he’s virtually invisible to the system. It will require a deeper dive to build a psychological profile.\n\nWhat he said to Sarah last night has fueled a larger theory: The reason Edgar has been off the radar is because he knows how to be. Because he and Leonard Church share simultaneous lives. There aren’t two Ash Killers; no copycat. They are two bodies driven by the same soul.\n\nNone of this is close to confirmed, and if it were, it would be based on volatile, unproven science that Sarah has barely discovered. But none of that matters to the three people who just caught a serial killer.\n\nMore unsettling to Grant is how Leonard Church and Edgar Troy share information. How do they know of each other, and what can they foretell? Is the reason Brian felt like he should have caught Edgar last night, but somehow didn’t, because at one point that was the timeline, but Leonard has access to all of Edgar’s life the way Marigold does with Brian and thus gave Edgar proper warning and prevented his capture?\n\nThe manipulation of time makes Grant’s head hurt. But he looks at his notes again, at a stoplight, grabbing his notebook from the passenger seat.\n\nITERATION ONE: Edgar Troy commits Denver murders. Is caught by Brian Huntley. Presumably he’s tried and found guilty and rots in prison for decades. Eventually passes.\n\nITERATION TWO: Edgar is reborn, earlier than when he started life as Edgar, this time as Leonard Church. Same drive to murder. Same ligature with the ash [significance?]. At some point, Leonard becomes aware Edgar is also him, living in the same time, and opens some channel to warn Edgar of when he is caught, even as Leonard himself is caught by the FBI in Michigan.\n\nEdgar then avoids capture instead, altering the timeline starting on September 2, 2023.\n\nMarigold, reborn with Brian Huntley’s soul, subconsciously senses time has been altered somehow, on the same date. Physical symptoms of an altered life include headaches, lost time, nightmares, tremors in the body. The future has been undone and rewritten, and no one else is aware of it.\n\nITERATION THREE: Grant and Sarah catch up to all of this and discover a second, and final, close encounter Brian has with Edgar Troy on October 30. Leonard would have no cause to warn Edgar of this until the moment Edgar’s life altered course once more, and he was captured by Brian after being pursued by Grant and Sarah.\n\nIn this scenario, Leonard would experience similar symptoms Marigold did when the timeline changed—or rather, was repaired to a close version of Iteration One.\n\nSarah notes in her handwriting under this: The timeline is still essentially broken—once altered, the future that it once was can never be reclaimed. In this case, Edgar managed to murder another victim last night. Her life’s trajectory undoubtedly carries a ripple effect to damage the future in some way, but how or how badly, neither Grant nor Sarah can know.\n\nIn all of this, one question nags at Grant the most. With Leonard doing all this work to save Edgar, why wouldn’t he also save himself, too? Or rather, if Leonard and Edgar learn about each other early enough, why would they let either of themselves get caught? Is there some timeline-logic pitfall or paradox Grant can’t see?\n\nIf he has had the ability to alter time, why is Leonard Church in prison?\n\nGrant returns his attention to the road when the car behind him honks at the green light.\n\nWhat concerns him most is not how much he knows. It’s how much the serial killer he’s about to visit knows.\n\nHis phone rings. He recognizes the number and sends it right to voicemail. It’s the third missed call from Brian Huntley’s desk. Grant knows how that phone call will go, when he’s ready to have it. But right now is not the time.\n\nRight as offices open on the East Coast, Grant voice-dials Quantico and navigates the menu to get to Dennis Polk, the director for the case who oversaw the arrest and conviction of Leonard Church. But someone else picks up instead—a woman with an even-toned voice who introduces herself as Deputy Director Lucy McAdams.\n\n“Predictive Analytics? I thought you guys were a data-mining operation, not a real agency. How can I help, Agent Lukather?”\n\n“I was hoping to speak with Director Polk on an urgent matter.”\n\n“How urgent?”\n\n“I have reason to believe Leonard Church has information critical to an active case. I’m on my way to ADX now, and I need Polk’s clearance for me to interview him. I know Church is on a strict watch list, so this is me being aboveboard with you.”\n\n“Ah. Well, two things. First, Lenny hasn’t opened up to anyone for years, so good luck getting a shred of useful info from him. And second, I can help you with that clearance, but Director Polk is no longer with us, I’m afraid.”\n\nGrant frowns. “What?”\n\n“He had a sudden stroke last night. Happened like that.” Grant hears her snap her fingers.\n\n“I didn’t know he had health issues.”\n\n“No one did.”\n\nA terrible thought occurs to Grant.\n\n“Deputy Director McAdams. Do you happen to know time of death?”\n\n“Like, you want the exact time, Agent?”\n\n“Close as you can.”\n\n“Let me check the report here.” There’s a moment of shuffling papers on the other end of the line, and McAdams clears her throat. “A little after midnight. His daughter Amy was up with him when it happened.”\n\n“Thank you, and my condolences.” Grant quickly ends the call and accelerates onto Route 115 south.\n\nA little after midnight on the East Coast puts it a little after ten o’clock here. Around the same time as the victim in Oak Hill Apartments. Is there a connection?\n\nGrant turns the question over in his head, feeling as confused, gravely concerned, but even more sure that Leonard Church might have all the answers. Grant pushes harder on the accelerator.\n\n* * *\n\n“There’s a lot you don’t know.”\n\nEdgar grins mischievously at Detective Huntley across the metal table. They’re in an exam room in the detention center, underground. Fluorescent lighting buzzes overhead like an electric hornet’s nest.\n\n“And you’re going to enlighten me now, is that it?”\n\n“More bodies. How I got the ash. Bring me a list of questions you wished Lenny Church would’ve answered for you, and I’ll tell all.”\n\nThe detective studies him for a quiet moment. “You got caught, so now you want to make sure you’re famous, is that it?”\n\n“Oh, I’m famous already.”\n\n“Right now, no one knows your story. I could go on national TV and ask if anyone’s heard of you, maybe I’d get a few calls.”\n\n“The Ash Killer is famous, though. People know that name.” Edgar leans back in his chair. “Besides, I’m going to write a book about it. This sort of thing sells.”\n\n“Then why do you need to confess to me? Won’t your book sell more if you reveal what you haven’t shared with law enforcement? Isn’t that how you narcissistic sociopaths work?”\n\nEdgar nods along. “I mean, yeah, but I want to have my names right. For my book. So. I thought we could swap information. Do a little free trade.”\n\n“Sure. It’s Brian with an I—B-R-I-A-N, and Huntley.”\n\n“Not you. Those two who ran into me on my way out. You must have interviewed them by now.”\n\nBrian keeps a poker face. “What makes you so curious about the people who held you up long enough for me to get you? You don’t want to focus on your murderous exploits instead?”\n\n“That wouldn’t be the whole story. And honestly, they should get their moment in the spotlight, too, after all.”\n\nAnother quiet moment stretches between the two. From elsewhere in the subterranean complex, a metal door buzzes open. The sound of foot traffic from other parts of the detention center bounces around in the hallway outside, sounding louder now, in the silence of the windowless room typically used for a physical examination of inbound detainees.\n\n“She told me you’d pull something like this,” Brian finally says.\n\n“Who?”\n\n“The psychic.”\n\n“I’m sorry—you hired a psychic?”\n\n“She said not to tell you a word. And frankly, this is out of character for me, but I’m going to agree with a practitioner of the mystic arts.”\n\nEdgar bristles at this. “Just tell me.”\n\nThe detective merely shakes his head no.\n\nSuch a simple act of refusal ignites a rage in Edgar. The man stands and pulls at the chains anchoring his arms to the floor. He lunges like a predatory cat in captivity at Brian, barking, “Tell me now!”\n\nIt startles Brian, who shoves away from the table, momentarily unsure if the restraints will hold. Then he returns to his senses and slowly stands. Grabs his jacket.\n\nEdgar’s tantrum evaporates as panic sets in. He pleads instead, “Hang on, hang on. Their names will all be revealed in the trial. You know? It’s not like this is confidential information. I’m going to hear about them eventually.”\n\n“Sure. And I’ll probably pick up a copy of your book one day, too.”\n\nBrian knocks on the door and a guard lets him out.\n\nEdgar seethes. “What are you afraid of? Huh?”\n\n* * *\n\nThe ADX compound covers a sprawling thirty-seven acres of land, with nearly a dozen layers of security from the front gate to the inside of any of its four major enclaves. For all the buildings, walls, gates, and concrete corridors, it houses only 360 criminals.\n\nGrant settles into his chair in an interview room that feels more like part of a space station than a federal detention center. There are no windows. The walls are padded and insulated. A thin hiss of air creates a steady current from some unseen vent near the ceiling, barely a slit. The LED system gives a cold ambience to the minimalist design of the space.\n\nThere’s the door leading in, built in a “man trap” design—an air lock of sorts, where one enters a chamber and wait to be let into the room by an operator monitoring from elsewhere.\n\nLeonard Church is escorted in by a bulky Florence ADX guard wearing a reinforced vest and carrying a baton. Church’s hands and feet are both restrained, so he shuffles more than walks to the chair opposite Grant, but he never breaks his gaze, which remains on Grant from the moment he steps in.\n\nThe guard speaks gruffly to Grant. And while Grant can hear him, he finds he’s unable to look away from Leonard, either.\n\n“Do not give him anything to eat or drink. Do not hand him any papers that are stapled together or bound with a paper clip. Do not let him touch a pen or pencil. You have twenty minutes, then I’ll come back to retrieve him. If you are ever in distress or wish to end the session before that time, raise your left hand over your head. Do you understand?”\n\nGrant nods. The guard leaves.\n\nLeonard and Grant stare at each other. Leonard speaks first.\n\n“You’re new.”\n\n“My name is Grant Lukather. I’m with Homeland Security. We’re doing—”\n\nLeonard talks over him. “Homeland Security? Isn’t that a generic term for something like two dozen different government agencies? You can be more specific, can’t you?”\n\nGrant narrows his eyes at Leonard. Picking up where he left off: “We’re doing an audit of your case to compare with the copycat Ash Killer currently in Denver. I’d like to ask you some questions.”\n\n“What kind of questions?”\n\n“Ones you’ve been asked before, but never answered. Now that there is someone else out there using your methods, even your signature, you may be more interested in cooperating.”\n\nLeonard tilts his head at Grant. Nods. “To defend my title as the one true Ash Killer? That sort of thing?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“It’s not a bad tactic to try, Agent.”\n\n“Pardon?”\n\n“But that isn’t why you’re here. You want answers to questions far beyond those written on a case audit file. Don’t you?”\n\nGrant shifts in his chair. He’s been trained to interrogate criminals, knows how power dynamics work, and Omar has commended him for outsmarting the most devious con artists Omar’s department has seen. And yet … Leonard behaves like a sociopath; a predator. No—more than that, Leonard’s mannerisms, his calmness and assuredness, it all presents as him knowing more than he should. Grant has seen versions of this behavior before. But this is the first time where it might be true. Where making eye contact with Leonard is an invitation, it’s opening a window and standing in paralysis as he climbs inside, smiling too widely, eyes too hungry. It’s a hunger for something precious to Grant. Something another person should not be able to devour. But with each breath that passes between them, Leonard’s gaze quietly convinces Grant otherwise.\n\n“I will ask you questions, and if you give me satisfactory answers, I can increase your outside time significantly. Right now it’s one hour a day, and the rest is solitary, yes?”\n\nLeonard stares at Grant. Does not confirm or deny.\n\nGrant continues, “Cooperate with me, and I’ll double it for a month.”\n\n“I don’t want outside time, Agent.”\n\nGrant blinks. “No? What do you want?”\n\n“As much as I loathe borrowing from pop culture, let’s use a familiar exchange. Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling. Quid pro quo. Hm?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Don’t tell me you haven’t seen that movie.”\n\n“I have. You’re saying you have questions for me?”\n\n“I do.”\n\nGrant finally turns his attention down to the open notebook in his lap. He’s written his questions with space for answers. They all start simply enough, but Leonard is right—the last questions border on the supernatural. Grant takes a breath.\n\n“All right. I go first. In the last four years, have you had any contact with a man named Edgar Troy?”\n\nLeonard smiles. It’s a relaxed smile. One that unnerves Grant.\n\n“Yes. Almost daily. We’re quite close.”\n\n“I’ve seen your visitor logs and phone records. How have you met with him?”\n\nLeonard wags his finger. “My turn, now.”\n\n“Fine.”\n\n“Who is the blond woman you were with? The one who wrecked your car.”\n\nParanoia shoots through Grant’s system like an electrical jolt. “Who?”\n\n“That’s what I’m asking, yes.”\n\n“How … I don’t— How do you know about her?”\n\n“You are stacking up more questions on your end but haven’t answered my first one, Agent Lukather. Do you not understand the basics of quid pro quo?”\n\nGrant balls his fists under the table. I’m not giving you what you want.\n\n“Ursula Hammond.” He has no idea how the name of his grade school science teacher came to him so quickly, but he is grateful.\n\nLeonard narrows his eyes at Grant. One hand reaches up and he lazily scratches his chin. A tattoo of something in Latin peeks from under the cuff of his jumpsuit sleeve.\n\n“Give me a minute,” Leonard tells him. And then the man closes his eyes with his hands at his sides. He takes a deep breath. Then another.\n\nGrant stares at him with a growing sense of dread. What is he doing? In all of his years of interrogations, he’s never seen this before.\n\nTen seconds go by. Then twenty.\n\nGrant clears his throat, to remark on his impatience with Leonard’s meditation, and finally speaks. “Leonard.”\n\nNo response at first. Then Leonard sucks in a breath like he’s emerging from underwater and opens his eyes. He blinks back into the present moment and then looks right at Grant.\n\n“There is no therapist with that name in the state of California. You’re lying to me, Agent.”\n\nGrant’s muscles freeze. His heart rattles under his ribs. How would he know?\n\n“Unless you have Google in your head, you have no way of knowing any therapist’s name.”\n\n“Then show me her file. Show me a photo. Prove it to me.”\n\nGrant makes no move for his notebook. He stares at Leonard.\n\nSensing he’s won this round, Leonard slouches and offers, “Or give me her real name and let’s get back to the Q and A.”\n\nGrant stares at Leonard, his mind working. Finally, he answers, “Sarah.”\n\n“Last name?”\n\n“That’s a second question for you.”\n\nLeonard makes a dismissive sound. “Oh, now you’re paying attention to the rules, good. Go on, then.”\n\n“How have you met with Edgar?”\n\n“We share a … spiritual connection.” Leonard scratches his chin. “Saves on phone bills.”\n\nGrant makes like he’s writing a note in his book, but his hand nervously sketches in the margins as he follows up: “You talk with him through hypno-regression therapy.”\n\n“No, but I guess that would be one— Oh, clever. Wasn’t a question, but you got a little more from me anyway.” Leonard shrugs. “That’s okay. I did, too.”\n\n“I’m sure you’d like to think that.”\n\n“Sarah is a hypnotherapist who specializes in past lives. Right?”\n\nGrant glares at Leonard.\n\nLeonard maintains that relaxed smile. Offers a small shrug. “It’s how she could stumble upon the truth of it.”\n\n“The truth?”\n\n“Not enough souls to go around.” Leonard’s smile spreads and he gestures wide. “State of the world these days, everyone’s having to work multiple jobs.”\n\nLeonard laughs as Grant stares at him. “Come on, it was a good joke and nobody else here would get it.”\n\n“You and Edgar—you’re the same soul?”\n\n“Yes. Who’s the patient?”\n\n“The patient?”\n\n“You’re the federal investigator, Sarah is the past-life therapist, so that leaves the instrument through which you deduced where Edgar would be last night. So.”\n\nThe men stare at each other again. Grant feels his grip on the interview slipping by the moment. Leonard remains calm. Unbothered.\n\nGrant speaks slowly. “I am not going to divulge that information.”\n\n“Shall we call the guard in, then?”\n\n“I’m not done with you.”\n\n“But if you won’t abide by what we agreed upon, I don’t see why I should entertain any more of this. I mean, you aren’t even asking the right questions.”\n\n“I’m not telling you any more names.”\n\nLeonard rolls his eyes. “That’s disappointing. Fine. Then tell me the last question you have written down on that list.”\n\n“What makes you think I have a list of questions?”\n\n“You seem prepared, and that is the most basic step for an interview. Go on. The final question for me.”\n\nGrant stares down at the list of questions.\n\nThe last on the list: Did you kill FBI Director Dennis Polk last night?\n\n“It’s about a man named Dennis Polk.” That’s as far as Grant will go, for now.\n\n“Oh. I bet I can guess the question now.”\n\n“That would be impressive. So, Leonard—impress me.”\n\n“No. If you aren’t answering all of my questions, I’m not answering that one. Mark it out.”\n\nGrant’s fist tightens at his side. He has to set the pencil down to keep from breaking it. Grant closes his notebook, trying to suppress the storm of anger and anxiety roiling in him.\n\nLeonard crosses his arms. “It’s still my turn. Since you won’t name Sarah’s client. Who else have you told about this phenomenon? I suspect this one is important to us both.”\n\n“No one else knows.”\n\nLeonard studies Grant. Watches his body language. After a moment, Leonard nods to himself, satisfied.\n\n“Good. Good. Now, ask me a real question. A scary one.”\n\nThe two men face each other at the table in the quiet hiss of the air conditioner. Don’t let him get in your head, Grant thinks. Remember the tricks, even killers have their tells.\n\n“What is the purpose of the ash?”\n\nLeonard claps his hands. “There we go. A popular one. Been asked that a hundred times. But finally, I’m sitting across from someone who’ll believe me.”\n\nGrant hovers his pencil over his notepad, but keeps his hands below the table so Leonard can’t see him. And Leonard speaks.\n\n“While plenty of smaller faiths and cults hold a belief in reincarnation, the major religions that really planted a flag in the ideology all hail from India and neighboring countries. The Hindus, Buddhists, Jaina, and Sikh have a hundred different little rituals among them about it. Some are just a relic of a culture that won’t reconcile with the fact that men are not above women. For all their past lives, the men can’t entertain that they’d be reborn as another gender and suffer the consequences of their own design.”\n\nLeonard blinks, returning to his story. “At any rate, you dig around enough and you find some rituals that adhere to very similar steps. The Hindus, for instance, smear a white clay on the forehead, called gopi candana. You see, the human soul is not one to detach from its mortal coil so easily. You can linger for days around your body, haunting the halls. Some faiths try to hasten that transition. Give you a little push, you know, to make sure you vacate.”\n\nLeonard leans forward and speaks in a lower voice. “But there’s an older cult that really refined this process. They curated a particular ash from the bones of the first hundred members of their faith, called it darwaza, and that stuff? Let me tell you. That kicks your soul right out.”\n\nGrant stares at him. “You’re destroying human souls.”\n\n“And you’re doing that thing again where you don’t phrase it as a question.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Trying to get two for one again? My turn. Have you lost any loved ones in your life? Family, spouse, close friend?”\n\nGrant’s blood rushes in his ears. The roaring distracts him; it sounds like a wildfire.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Elaborate.”\n\n“You should’ve worded the question differently. I answered. Now. Why?”\n\n“Not destroying. I haven’t figured that part out, yet. But when I turn the lights off in someone with this ash on their head, it’s so effective, it ejects their soul from every iteration. No matter who else they are, no matter how far away their other lives may be, their shared soul gets the same eviction.”\n\nLeonard gleams with pride. He holds out his hands and nods, as if to a standing ovation.\n\n“But—but why would—” Grant stops himself from the follow-up, seeing Leonard’s smug grin of satisfaction. “Fine.”\n\nLeonard leans forward again, like he’s flirting with Grant. “Tell me who this person was to you, including how you knew you loved them and the circumstances of their death.”\n\n“I don’t know why you would want any of that.”\n\n“You can ask me that as your next question, but answer mine first.”\n\nGrant closes his notebook. Folds his arms over his chest. He stops looking at Leonard. If I give him something emotionally honest, he’ll give me what I want.\n\n“I didn’t understand the scope of love. Its reach or its depth. I grew up loving my parents, but that is a hardwired kinship. It wasn’t a choice. It wasn’t a discovery. I had girlfriends in high school and college. I told them I loved them because I thought I was—I thought the attraction and the chemistry was really all there was to that, and romance was the fantasy you put over it to make it feel like something more.”\n\nGrant absently rubs at the callus on his knuckle where he grips his pencil. “And then I met a woman who reinvented the word. And we had one year together, but time slowed when I was with her, so it was more like five years, or ten, stretched out over those months.”\n\nLeonard studies him carefully. Like a scientist would a lab animal. Grant wills himself not to get emotional. He controls his breathing and blinks away the stinging in his eyes. “Anyway, she died in a fire. End of story.”\n\n“Thank you, Grant. Now ask me the follow-up.”\n\n“Why would you want to perform a ritual like this with your kills? More directly, why go to all this trouble?”\n\n“I work hard at what I do, Agent Grant Lukather. I take pride in it. Better or worse, the thrill and satisfaction of what I do, it’s a runner’s high. It’s where my thoughts go in idle moments. It’s what I feel I was designed to do.” Leonard sits back, and in a rare moment of visible disappointment, he looks at his lap. “If they just keep on living like normal in other bodies, it makes what I do almost irrelevant. Marginal. I don’t matter, in the grand scheme.”\n\nHe takes a breath, and that shark’s smile starts to spread again. “But with the ash, I make the system pay attention. I show them how I can make a difference. You aren’t a carnival Whac-A-Mole game mocking me anymore. You’re just bowling pins.”\n\nHis eyes shine at Grant. “Look at how many I can topple at once, now.”\n\nGrant stands, collecting his things. He nods at the guard on the other side of the door. He wants nothing more than to get out of this room; get away from this man.\n\nBefore he gets two steps to the door, Leonard clicks his tongue. “And to think you didn’t ask the really interesting question this whole time.”\n\nGrant stops. He wrestles with whether to take the bait, aware Leonard may just be fishing for more information from Grant. He remains quiet. But as he takes another step:\n\n“If I have this transcendental vision, if I can do what you’ve done, only better, why wouldn’t I save myself, right? Why would I be here?”\n\nGrant turns back around, meeting Leonard’s almost meditative gaze once more.\n\n“It doesn’t make sense, you’re right. Unless you and Edgar didn’t establish your special connection until after you were put here.”\n\nLeonard shakes his head. “The way we do it, we’ve known for years. All of us have.”\n\nGrant holds his breath. All of us?!\n\nLeonard smiles, watching the barbs of that concept dig into Grant’s mind. Leonard then follows with “I’m sure you realize just how special this is. But it’s only special if I’m the only one driving. The more who are aware—who are out there altering my future with theirs—the more problematic it all becomes. So. Can you guess why I’m here, now?”\n\nGrant hides his hands again, feeling them tremble at his sides.\n\n“You’ve been on the lookout for someone like me.”\n\nLeonard smiles. “Good luck out there, Agent.”",

      "content": "16. When It All Starts To Unravel\n\nWHEN IT ALL STARTS TO UNRAVEL\n\nGrant is halfway back to Denver, driving like a madman, “all of us” still ringing in his head, when he gets the call from his boss at the main office. “Grant, I’m glad you answered. Seems you’ve been dodging calls today.”\n\nGrant can hear the tension in Omar’s voice and takes a breath before getting into it.\n\n“The situation in Denver has been fluid the last fifteen hours, sir.”\n\n“As has your understanding of state and federal law, from what I’m hearing.”\n\n“This is bigger than the case on Detective Huntley’s desk.”\n\n“It’s getting there. I’ve had a few very uncomfortable conversations this morning, and not just with Denver. Do you want to explain what happened last night with your civilian consultant and, apparently, a mystic?”\n\nGrant scrambles for his phone and looks for notifications that may have landed while he was interviewing Leonard.\n\nHe finds a text from Sarah: Marigold told police she’s a psychic!\n\nGrant frowns for a moment, and then his face lights up with relief. A psychic. Of course.\n\n“The client of my therapist is able to predict events before they happen. I’ve been using all the tools you taught me to discern what tricks she’s using—be it cold reading, or Barnum tactics, or even the more robust software options like we’ve seen out of Boston lately.”\n\n“Right. And?”\n\n“None of those are in play here. And yet, last night we stopped a serial killer.”\n\nOmar goes quiet for a moment, but Grant can hear him shuffling a deck of cards as he considers what Grant just told him.\n\nGrant keeps going. “I’m putting this through the paces, but if it’s a con, it’s orchestrated across several states, with a team of strangers, no paper trail, for no discernible financial or political gain, and now it’s also proving to be effective at catching criminals.”\n\nGrant no longer believes any of this. He finds himself saying things he knows Omar would want to hear, playing the role of the skeptic. He knows the phenomenon is real, and with that comes the terrible, creeping dread that others will latch on to it.\n\n“Hmm” is Omar’s reply.\n\n“I know.”\n\n“I didn’t say anything.”\n\n“But I know what you’re thinking. You’ve never encountered the real deal before.”\n\n“In all our time here.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Not a single one.”\n\n“I know.”\n\n“Denver PD has put out an all-points on you, Grant. You left town after being a key witness at a crime. And that’s made some people understandably nervous.”\n\n“I’m solving this case, sir.”\n\n“Which one? The Ash Killer, or the pipeline predictor?”\n\n“They’re connected.”\n\nOmar relents. “I’ll see what I can do to clear you from Denver for now, but you need to get on a plane, Grant. Walk me through it. Wheel in the whiteboard if you need it.”\n\nGrant thinks of Sarah and Marigold still stuck in town, under the suspicious eye of local police. Every cop has an allergy to the word psychic. He knows they won’t let either woman leave without thoroughly investigating them. For a copycat killer to be as successful as Edgar has been, the assumption would be he had help. Coordination.\n\nGoing back to Predictive Analytics puts Grant at every disadvantage. If Omar believes Grant is onto something legit, Omar could take over and investigate it personally. Finding the real thing is what has driven him for years.\n\nBut Omar might also see the inherent global risks with it. Of everyone Grant has met in his time at the Bureau, Omar is the one person he would trust to protect the right people. Even people who had not yet been endangered.\n\n“Honestly, I could use your help with this. I’m too in the weeds. Some of it, I think it’s ironclad, and you know how much it takes to get me to say it.”\n\nOmar waits on the other side. Aware silence can be the best response at times.\n\nGrant adds, “But I need you to promise me something.”\n\n“Promise you what?”\n\n“You have to keep this utterly confidential. Do not share details of this case with anyone else. Just you and me.”\n\n“What about the two consultants in Denver?”\n\n“Give me a day, and I’ll bring Sarah and Marigold with me.” Buying time. To find a way through this, he’ll need to go over what to say and how to react to their story under extreme scrutiny. Because Grant fears the future where Marigold is put away in some lab with a government hypnotist mining her for details about the future. Using Brian Huntley like Grant and Sarah have, except for stock market manipulation. Or political interference. War. Spycraft. The more they broke the future, the worse Marigold would get. They’d use her up until she had such a reaction to something they changed, it would break her brain.\n\nAnd Sarah? She’s a liability to anyone in power who knows what she knows. Simplest solution there would be to kill her and cover it up. Same goes with me, Grant acknowledges. Omar wouldn’t pull that trigger, but he might believe too much in the system. If he took this to the wrong people—of which there are mostly wrong people in seats of power—it would mean certain death for Sarah, Grant, and even Omar.\n\n“You really want me to promise you all this? You realize whoever asks for secrecy is either the con artist setting up the mark, or it’s the mark being used by the grifter.”\n\n“I know.”\n\n“That’s what you sound like.”\n\n“I sound scared, Omar. When have you known me to be scared?”\n\nGrant isn’t lying. Running alongside these thoughts racing through his mind is a new fear, fresh off his session with Leonard Church. If Leonard is aware of the phenomenon, and exploiting it, Grant could have a brand-new problem on his hands. Why would a man in a maximum-security prison be so keen to get Sarah’s and Marigold’s names? The police have Edgar in custody. How many other iterations of Leonard are out here in the world? Is the soul of the Ash Killer inhabiting yet another body right now, or multiple bodies, and are they aware of what Grant and Sarah just did?\n\nAre they being hunted?\n\nGrant was facing this idea earlier, when he and Sarah discovered Marigold’s life before Brian was yet another simultaneous existence; the grieving mother, Agatha, whose daughter was murdered by Leonard. Why didn’t they explore this expansion sooner?\n\nHe knows the truth even as he reprimands himself for not properly asking himself the question before: It’s because the thought of multiple iterations of people alive at the same time, governed by the same soul, scrambles Grant’s brain. It is a jump to a level of math he is not ready to handle.\n\nIt’s then that Grant remembers how Leonard was able to pull information seemingly from thin air, simply by controlling his breathing with his eyes closed. Does Leonard access his other lives more directly with a different method? Can you time travel through deep-breathing exercises? Meditation?\n\nOmar breaks Grant’s thoughts, barking from the speakerphone, “Be here at six o’clock tonight, Grant. On your own.” Omar hangs up, leaving Grant to the quiet of the car.\n\nGrant realizes he’s been speeding along the freeway this whole time. He slows down and tucks into traffic in a slower lane, to look inconspicuous as he ponders his next move.\n\n* * *\n\n“I just told him,” Sarah says to Marigold. They’re standing at the breakfast buffet line at the hotel, inching their trays along.\n\nMarigold, who was miles away in thought, blinks at her. “Who? What?”\n\n“Grant. I texted him your cover story.”\n\n“What did he say?”\n\n“He hasn’t replied.” Sarah anxiously loops her hair in one finger. “Is that bad? Are we in trouble, you think?”\n\n“We’re not out of trouble, that’s for sure.” A few hours earlier, when she spoke with Brian, Marigold felt such a thrilling rush. She was close to another human sharing the same soul. She was fascinated by Brian. It was like looking at a save file in a game that lets you create your own custom character each time. Physically, he’s completely different from her. But she suspects they both have the same moral compass, make the same key choices, and deal with conflict or rejection or attraction similarly. It was a strange experience to be in the same room with him. Maybe the wine was a factor, too, but she felt safe.\n\nNow, none of it feels reassuring. Marigold’s thoughts keep returning to the reality of the situation. Her brilliant solution to explain why she, Sarah, and Grant were all in town might be neither brilliant nor a solution, the more she thinks about it. Because now she’s fully in the spotlight. It means she’s the one under the microscope with police, instead of Sarah or Grant. This is a big enough case to warrant almost nightly news coverage in Denver, and some national news as well. It means she’ll be pursued by reporters for interviews. Her personal life will be dug up and picked apart. She has no website or palm-reading service or self-help book out to back up her claim of being a mystic. She’s just this software developer from California who told police she had a vision of the Ash Killer, and she was right.\n\nThe world will chew me up and spit me out, she thinks as she pays for her breakfast and shuffles to a quiet booth in a corner.\n\nSarah follows moments later and settles in opposite her. Sarah’s still buzzing with nerves, like a high school girl going on her first date. “Grant just texted me.”\n\n“Where is he?” Marigold asks, weirdly troubled by Grant’s choice of text versus calling or—Marigold’s preference—showing up in person.\n\n“He has to rush back to Washington, but he has new information.”\n\n“Where did he get new information?”\n\nSarah holds up a hand: “Let me at least tell you, first!”\n\nMarigold quiets herself by shoveling scrambled eggs into her mouth.\n\nSarah reads from her phone: “‘Three things: First, the special ash is linked to some ancient ritual. It banishes the soul from the body upon death. But in this case, it means every body that shares the same soul.’”\n\nMarigold blinks. Does that mean I could drop dead if Brian were killed with the ash on? Hang on, hang on—\n\n“‘Second, there is a chance the Ash Killer is in multiple bodies right now. Do not let strangers get near you. Be on your guard.’”\n\nMarigold is still processing the first revelation when she mutters, “So, continue to be a woman in everyday society, thanks, Grant.”\n\nSarah ignores that and barrels on to the last part of his text. “He’ll be back soon. And he just told us again to be careful and not talk to law enforcement more than absolutely necessary. He will sort this out for us.”\n\n“Will he?” Marigold asks, more to herself than Sarah. But it unsettles her.\n\nSarah puts her phone down and picks up her fork. She realizes she’s famished. As she smothers her pancakes with maple syrup, she talks in that happy voice of someone either overly excited or overly anxious. “We’re the good guys here, it’ll be fine. We caught the killer. We should be celebrating. Right? I mean, you’re feeling great, aren’t you?”\n\nMarigold nods. It’s true, she’s not had even a blip of missing time, and the aching sensation in the back of her skull has finally vanished, reminding her what it was like to live without chronic pain.\n\n“We did a good thing, yes?”\n\n“We did! We did.” Then why do we feel so much dread, Marigold thinks.\n\n“Oh, shoot. I forgot to get myself some bacon.” Sarah pushes her eggs around on the plate for a bit as Marigold shakes her head.\n\n“It’s because you’re used to Grant giving you his.”\n\nSarah blushes. “What? No. What?”\n\n“Yeah. You two are constantly flirting. I could power my car with the tension between you.”\n\n“That is not true!” Sarah’s face gets redder, her eyes panicked.\n\nMarigold tries not to look smug. She can’t stand smugness on someone else, and she refuses to dress in it herself. But Sarah makes it hard on her. “Come on. Are you really going to ignore the hot federal agent who clearly is into you?”\n\n“I. Am. Engaged.”\n\n“Engaged is not married.”\n\nSarah puts her silverware down and leans in like a spy in a bad play. In a half whisper: “We set a date already.”\n\n“Wow. Well, I guess you’re locked in. Nobody ever backed out of an engagement before.”\n\nSarah frowns at Marigold. The power dynamic in their relationship has swayed hard the other way, and Sarah doesn’t like it.\n\n“Grant has been nothing but professional with me. As I hope I have with you as your therapist.”\n\nMarigold holds up her hands in surrender, not out to rile her up. “You are an amazing therapist, Sarah. Look at where we are. Look at what you’ve done.”\n\n“Thank you.”\n\n“But you’re a total mess.”\n\nSarah puffs up for barely a second before deflating. Slouched, staring down at her baconless plate, she mutters, “I know. I just … I feel comfortable with Travis. And I think maybe I make Grant nervous, or he makes me nervous—either way, we’re too different.”\n\nMarigold shakes her head at Sarah. “I’m not going to talk smack to my own therapist about relationships, you do you.”\n\n“Thank you,” Sarah says, regretting how pouty it sounded the moment she blurted it.\n\n“There’s something I’ve been wanting to say,” Marigold starts, suddenly vulnerable.\n\nSarah notices the change in Marigold’s posture and softens. “Yeah?”\n\n“You really took a great risk, coming out here with me. Both of you. I know that’s making us all very nervous now—maybe more nervous than when we were staking out the apartment waiting to capture a killer. But I just want to say, Sarah … thank you.”\n\nSarah smiles. It’s an honest, warm smile. Marigold stays in that warmth for a moment, until it fades for both women and they are left to ponder the consequences of their choices.\n\nSarah finally speaks. “What do you think will happen?”\n\n“To us?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nMarigold shrugs. Takes a bite of her blueberry muffin.\n\nThen, at the same time, both women look back up at each other, thinking the same thought. Marigold is first to respond.\n\n“Shall we find out?” She taps her temple.\n\n“I mean”—Sarah grins back—“we do happen to know the best way to get a peek, no?”\n\nMarigold beams. “Right? Why didn’t we consider this sooner?”\n\n“Maybe because this is the first time it actually involves us? Like you as Marigold, and me? Before it’s felt like a play put on by someone else.”\n\n“Now we’re the ones onstage.”\n\nThe two of them finish up their breakfast as quickly as possible, then get up to go to Marigold’s hotel room.\n\n“Do you feel you can do this now?”\n\n“I do,” Marigold answers.\n\n“I can open the minibar if you want.”\n\n“I’m past the jitters, really. I feel ready. Let’s do this.”\n\nAt the elevator lobby, Marigold reaches out to press the UP button but instead doubles over and vomits on the carpet, with no forewarning from her body. The urge hits like blunt-force trauma. Her head suddenly feels as if it were in an aquarium tipping over, her whole body growing cold, the ill effect hitting her faster than food poisoning.\n\n“Marigold! Are you okay?”\n\nSarah catches her before Marigold collapses entirely on the floor.\n\nMarigold struggles to focus her vision. Racked by nausea and an icicle of stabbing pain in the back of her head.\n\n“No, I’m not,” she manages, full of dread. “Let’s find out why.”\n\n* * *\n\nBrian’s phone chirps as he’s riding in Allen’s beat-up SUV on their way back to Oak Hill Apartments. Allen glances over at him from the driver’s seat.\n\n“Unknown caller. Rolling the dice here,” Brian says before answering. “Hello?”\n\n“Is this Detective Huntley?” It’s a woman’s voice Brian doesn’t recognize.\n\n“That’s right, who’s this?”\n\n“Um, my name is Abigail Thompson. I got your number from the, uh, dispatch lady. I think, um, you’re the one on the Ash Killer case?” She has a soft singsong voice; a little manic.\n\n“Yeah, that’s right. If you have any tips, there’s a hotline—”\n\n“Oh, this isn’t a tip about the killer, but, um, it’s something that might be relevant?”\n\nBrian massages his forehead with his free hand. The lack of sleep is catching up to him. “Okay? I’m listening. Go on, Abigail.”\n\n“Maybe I’m wrong, I hope I’m wrong. But are you working with, um, a psychic?”\n\nBrian sits up. “Where did you hear this?”\n\n“My sister.”\n\n“How did she hear about it?”\n\n“Um. Well. She’s a psychic, too.”\n\nBrian blinks, momentarily at a loss for words.\n\nAbigail continues, “I think you should talk to her. Soon. My sister, I mean.”\n\n“Why is that?”\n\n“The woman you’re working with is lying to you.”\n\n“Lying about what?”\n\n“I don’t know, that’s just what I heard Jess—my sister—that’s what I heard her say.”\n\n“Can you put Jess on?”\n\n“She doesn’t like the phone. But, um, if you come here, she will see you.”\n\n“Where is here?”\n\n“Boulder, near Valmont.”\n\nBrian starts writing in his notepad. Allen keeps peering over at him as he drives. He catches Brian’s attention and mouths, Speakerphone? Brian waves him off.\n\n“Abigail, who was she talking to when she said this?”\n\n“Lawrence.”\n\n“Is Lawrence there right now? Can you put him on the phone?”\n\n“Oh, no.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“Lawrence is dead.”\n\nBrian blinks again. He can feel himself slide in his seat. The weight of the strangeness surrounding his case—his whole job—is starting to fatigue him in a way nothing else has. “Right, yeah, that would make sense why he can’t come to the phone…”\n\n“Can you come see us? It sounds important.”\n\n“Give me your address. I have a full plate but I can get there this evening.”\n\n“Um, okay. Thank you. I’m sorry.”\n\n“Why are you sorry?”\n\n“I never like calling someone I never met with bad news.”\n\n“That’s okay, Abigail. Bad news is all I get.”\n\nHe ends the call and stares out the passenger window. His phone dings, and he checks it to find Abigail has sent him an apartment number and street address in Boulder.\n\nAllen lets his partner have quiet for a moment before “So? What was that?”\n\n“A second psychic has a tip for us.”\n\n“Another one? Sheesh, they’re coming out of the woodwork.” Then: “But for the record, I don’t buy Marigold’s story. Just reminding you.”\n\n“Yeah, yeah.”\n\n“So, we going to this other one?”\n\n“I’m not gonna make you trek it all the way to Boulder. I’ll drive out later.”\n\nAllen shakes his head. “Brian, this is the most exciting thing I got going now. If I go home tonight, Meredith is gonna make us watch more of that dating show. Please. Save me.”\n\nBrian grins. Allen gives him the puppy-dog eyes, and they both laugh.\n\n“All right, man.”\n\n“There’s a great barbecue joint on the way, too.”\n\nAllen’s SUV pulls up to the road where Brian found Edgar with a bloody knife, in front of two wrecked cars. In daylight, the road seems smaller, the world around it more mundane now that it’s not cloaked in the dark of night. Police tape cordons off the street on both sides, and a forensic team finishes up their eight-hour shift.\n\nThe street is littered with little marks of tape where some piece of evidence had been spotted, photographed, and then carefully lifted and bagged for the lab. Most of it was likely debris from the vehicles. Shards of glass, plastic from headlights and windshield wipers, spilled motor oil and other fluids, all tell a story of how the collision occurred. But more interesting to Brian is the spatter of blood from a cut, or a shoe print directing him to Edgar’s path from the apartment complex across the ditch.\n\nMost of all, Brian would like to find the ash.\n\nEdgar didn’t have it on him, wouldn’t share where it went or how he acquired it in the first place. Which just left scouring the crime scene for it.\n\nBrian ducks under the police tape as a jogger with a set of earbuds in his ears finds his way around the crime scene, oblivious of the police activity. The music is loud enough for Brian to hear it. Nothing can interrupt the cardio for some people, he thinks.\n\nThe jogger looks back as he passes Allen’s SUV and rakes a hand through his white hair. In his jacket pocket he grips a muddy shoe-polish tin, containing a small amount of ash.\n\n* * *\n\nMarigold lies on her back, staring up at the ceiling of her room. Her nausea has passed, but her head still throbs as if something were trying to crawl out of it, and she feels like she’s running a fever. She’s changed into pajamas, not for any practical reason but more because she never feels comfortable lying in a bed fully clothed. Sarah sits by the bedside. The room fills with the steady, low thrum of the metronome Sarah has placed on a small shelf over the bed.\n\n“Take a deep breath and close your eyes.”\n\nMarigold does so.\n\n“I’m going to count down from ten.”\n\nSarah calmly talks through her ritual. Marigold releases the tension in her shoulders, her hands, her feet, and in the darkness of her internal world feels herself falling down the chasm once more.\n\n“Six. Five…”\n\n* * *\n\nMarigold floats in the void, the ribbon like a hastily drawn squiggle of red that leads off into oblivion before her. Her hair sways rhythmically, pushed with each pulse of the reverberation of the metronome. Somewhere, a million miles away and also right in her ear, Sarah’s disembodied voice compels her to go deeper—to return to the life of Brian Huntley.\n\nMarigold reaches out to the ribbon to pull it free, but when her fingers touch it, she gets a sharp sting like an electrical charge runs through it.\n\nShe tries again. The pain is still sharp, but Marigold holds tight and pulls at the ribbon.\n\nThe ribbon pulls back.\n\nMarigold is yanked farther into the void, until she passes through a fog, and the fog dissipates to reveal a landscape of a sparkling city a thousand feet below her.\n\nShe falls.\n\n* * *\n\nSarah watches Marigold intently. Marigold’s eyes flit about under their lids, as if she were in REM sleep. The bedcovers shush and bunch up around Marigold’s hands as she tenses up. Her breathing changes.\n\n“Are you there? Have you returned to Brian?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What day is it?”\n\n“Halloween night.”\n\nSarah pauses. Today is Halloween. Why did she start here? This shouldn’t be her entry point into her previous life. “What do you see? What is Brian doing?”\n\nMarigold’s breath grows shallow.\n\nSarah course-corrects the moment she notices. “Listen to my voice. You are safe. Put yourself as an observer, removed from participation.” And then, as Marigold’s breathing steadies, Sarah treads carefully. “What do you see?”\n\n“The last moments of my life.”\n\n* * *\n\nIn a darkened apartment corridor, a woman with a severe-looking face and a beak of a nose has Brian’s arms pinned, while a man with a placid expression wearing a set of frameless glasses pulls Brian’s sidearm from its holster. “Keep your head still,” he tells Brian.\n\nMarigold stands in the hallway like a ghost, watching in horror as Brian struggles, shouts, and kicks. No one else notices her. From somewhere both in the atmosphere and also inside Marigold, Sarah’s voice ebbs in, calm but commanding. “Remember, remain detached. You are not Brian in this moment, you are one step removed. Focus on the details. Faces, names, numbers. Tell me what they are saying to Brian.”\n\n“I’ve got him,” says the severe woman.\n\nAt the end of the corridor, the stairwell door opens and Brian’s partner, Allen, stumbles in. He’s pale, out of breath, and bleeding profusely from his gut.\n\n“Allen!” shouts Brian, and a moment later a gunshot goes off like a loud clap and Allen falls face-first, revealing a young man in a biker jacket holding Allen’s gun, standing in the stairwell.\n\nThe young man steps in and shoots a second time into Allen’s back. Casually. Calmly.\n\nThe man with the glasses smears a thumb of ash on Brian’s forehead.\n\n“Stop it, stop it—let me go goddammit!”\n\nBrian makes a last-ditch effort to break free of the two, elbowing the woman and kicking at the man. It works. He finally slips out of the woman’s vise grip and shoves the man toward the biker-jacket shooter, lunging for the one open apartment door where his police pistol had been tossed in a moment ago.\n\nInstead, he comes face-to-face with a teenage girl, her hair in a ponytail. Grinning at him.\n\nShe points his gun at his head. He holds up a hand: “Wait wait—”\n\nThe girl holds up her finger to her mouth in a shushing gesture. “Say good night, Sarah.”\n\nThe muzzle flashes.\n\nMarigold screams, but no one can hear her. From some unseen source, a red ribbon lashes out and wraps around her waist, yanking her through the wall like a ghost.\n\n* * *\n\nSarah recoils from her chair at Marigold’s bedside. She stares at the body of the hypnotized woman on the bed, suddenly aware at how all the anxiety and nausea Marigold was experiencing a moment ago has now transferred to Sarah.\n\n“What … what did that girl tell Brian?”\n\nWith her eyes still closed, Marigold repeats, “‘Say good night, Sarah.’”\n\nSarah gasps, her heart suddenly pounding in her chest. Her eyes dart around the room as if she were being watched right now. She rushes to the door and slides the security lock, then turns out the desk lamp, plunging the room into near darkness.\n\nThey’re coming for us, she thinks. Starting with our eyes into the future.",

Outnumbered Against One\n\nOUTNUMBERED AGAINST ONE\n\nBy the time Grant navigates his way out of the Dulles International Airport and climbs into a taxi, it’s nearly five o’clock. He tips the driver to “bend any laws” necessary to get them to the Homeland Security building by six, and with an alarming display of aggressive driving, the cabbie skids up to the front driveway with ten minutes to spare.\n\nBefore Grant ventures into the Predictive Analytics floor, he stops at the men’s restroom and tries to make himself look less like he hasn’t slept for more than a few hours in the last week. His hair is a mess, he has bags under his eyes, and his clothes are wrinkled from hours of travel. But, mercifully, the restroom has a supply of hygiene products and Grant gives himself a few minutes to clean up.\n\nCharlotte had made him more aware of these things, back when they first started dating. “You don’t want to seem like a stray dog,” she’d say with that bright voice of hers, “or else someone else is going to try and adopt you away from me.” He could still hear the sound of her laugh. It was a saved file in his mind, replayed when he needed a microdose of joy, or when he was feeling lonely and chose to torture himself with grief and regret.\n\nGrant took a centering breath as he dried his hands and prepped for his meeting with Omar. This could work. He has been a boss and a friend for years. There’s a feeling of mutual trust. Grant recalls one of the first meetings he had with Omar. The man made him learn a card trick. “It’s just sleight of hand, Grant,” Omar said. “You have the card in the cuff of your sleeve. It’s this motion with your wrist”—Omar demonstrated—“that causes the card to jump into your palm, where you can snare it by pinching your thumb and pinkie, like so.”\n\nOmar made him try it until he got it right three times in a row. That took an hour. It drove Grant mad; he was there to catch criminals and close cases, not put on some magic show. But Omar was insistent. Every performance review, Grant had a new card trick to learn. It was the most unorthodox business practice he’d encountered, and yet he began looking forward to it. Omar turned what would have been a dry, depressing job and made it entertaining.\n\nNothing like Grant’s parents.\n\nBeing raised by an engineer and a math teacher made for a dry, depressing childhood. It wasn’t that they didn’t occasionally express their love for him, in their own way, but they never encouraged anything as fanciful and absurd as card tricks. They didn’t even play normal card games, come to think of it. His best friend in school once remarked that Grant’s parents might be Vulcan, they were so logical and serious.\n\nThe two people who’d begun Grant’s transformation into someone who could not only enjoy a good card trick but perform one, and who could even crack a joke and care for a pet, were his boss, Omar, and Charlotte. That’s why I’m stalling in the bathroom, Grant thinks. I don’t want to go into his office and lose the one friend I have left by sounding like a madman.\n\nBut there was no other move to make. His phone buzzes in his pocket—the alarm, set for six o’clock. It’s now or never.\n\nOmar’s office is still the same beacon of amusement set against the beige partitions of the cubicle farm. Through the glass door Grant can see Omar at his desk, idly shuffling a Hoyle deck in his hands, performing some exercises that keep his fingers nimble with the cards. He’s looking off to one corner, staring at his computer or the mounted TV, when Grant opens the door and steps through.\n\n“I’m here. And I have a lot to say.”\n\n“I bet you do,” Omar replies. “I’m angry at you still, but it’s damn good to see you in the flesh, Grant.” Omar stands, as if to step around and shake Grant’s hand or embrace him, but instead he points—“I’d like you to meet US Marshal Nathan Hawkes.”\n\nStanding from a corner chair, where Omar had been looking, is a man in his late forties, wearing a marshal’s coat over jeans and a dark shirt. A man with short-cropped dark hair and an intense gaze.\n\n“Pleasure to meet you, Agent Lukather,” he says, holding out a hand.\n\nGrant shakes, aware of the man’s brutal grip. “What brings you out here, Marshal?”\n\nOmar chimes in first. “He’s been shedding some light on what could have led your investigation to spiral out the way it has.”\n\nGrant tenses, but hides it by cracking his knuckles after the handshake. “Oh?”\n\nNathan smiles. “Your case? My case? Same case.”\n\n“What do you mean by that?”\n\nOmar leans against his desk. “Nathan says he’s been pursuing a fugitive who has been stealing from her victims in a clever way—tell him, Nathan.”\n\n“She hypnotizes them without their knowledge.”\n\nGrant frowns. “What do you mean?”\n\n“I don’t have any firsthand experience with her, but she’s very good at establishing herself as an authority and then getting her mark to pay for whatever she wants.”\n\nGrant looks to Omar and then back to Nathan. “That isn’t relevant to my case.”\n\n“No?” Omar asks. “Did you not expense airline tickets and hotel rooms for two civilians to my account recently?”\n\n“That’s different,” Grant says.\n\n“One alias my fugitive has used before is Seana Newsome. That’s close enough to Sarah Newcomb—the name of your contact, no?”\n\n“That’s … yes, but the woman I met in Santa Monica has a business with an office, an assistant, clients—she’s engaged to someone in the district attorney’s office. That isn’t something a con artist can simply make with the wave of a wand. She’s legitimate.”\n\n“Is she?” Nathan shrugs. “Do you believe you’ve been fully lucid and cognizant the entire time you’ve been in the same room?”\n\n“Of course.”\n\n“Has she hypnotized anyone in your presence?”\n\nGrant pauses before answering, “Yes.”\n\n“And would that include the use of trance-inducing implements such as light strobes or audio devices?”\n\nGrant pauses again. “Where is this going?”\n\nNathan looks to Omar as if to say, I told you so. And that simple smirk makes Grant furious.\n\n“There may be a very different explanation for whatever you’ve experienced, is what the marshal is saying,” Omar says.\n\nNathan nods at Grant.\n\nGrant doesn’t accept it. “I know when I’m awake. That’s not this. Sarah is real.”\n\n“Where is she now?” Nathan asks plainly.\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\nOmar crooks an eyebrow at Grant. “You don’t know?”\n\n“Last time I saw them, they were in Denver. To speak with detectives there.”\n\nNathan crosses his arms. “You have their cell numbers? Her and the so-called client?”\n\n“If you want to talk to them, I’ll bring them in. You’re not having this conversation without me.” Grant adds, to Omar, “This is why I wanted you to see them yourself.”\n\n“Don’t take this personally,” Nathan tells Grant, “but you’ve been around my fugitive long enough to become an unreliable narrator. What you believe to be true—even entire blocks of time—could be completely invented by her. This is how she gets you into whatever narrative she needs to manipulate you. Appeals to your sense of justice and has you track down a serial killer in Colorado. Makes you fly her and her collaborator out, has you pay for a rental car, and before you know it, you believe you’ve been chasing a satellite tech through the ditch to save her life. So, let me hunt this one down.”\n\nGrant’s head spins. The wording Nathan just used: Blocks of time—is he referencing Marigold’s missing time? How would he know? Something else is—\n\nGrant blinks, as a realization grips him. His posture changes.\n\n“I didn’t tell anyone I chased the killer through a ditch.”\n\nNathan frowns. “Huh?”\n\n“No one told the cops that. No one knows where I was last night, beyond the two people you claim are criminals.”\n\nOmar now turns his gaze of doubt onto the marshal. “That’s right. Detective Huntley didn’t even share that with me, and he gave me a full rundown.”\n\nNathan sighs and rolls his eyes, muttering, “Well, shit.”\n\nHe then quick-draws his sidearm at his hip holster and shoots Omar twice in the chest.\n\nThe sound is a deafening clap that jolts Grant into hyperfocus. Time slows. He sees the utter surprise on Omar’s face as he begins to slide down the desk. He watches as Nathan’s gun arm starts to swivel toward Grant as the next target. Grant’s own screams inside his head, his urge at a molecular level to dive for Omar, to put pressure on the wound, to carry him out and get him to a hospital—all of it gets smothered by the survival instinct powering up in his veins.\n\nGrant moves. Shoving himself backward, out of the office doorway and out of Nathan’s line of sight. His combat brain reminds him he left his Sig Sauer in Denver, to avoid checking it at security and possibly missing his flight. But he has a holdout pistol in his desk here at the office. Only six rounds, and twenty-two caliber, but it’s a gun.\n\nHis body moves. His legs twist and strain and push off the floor to launch him into the cubicle bullpen, where his desk is, where there’s more cover from this gunman, where a chance at surviving the night could be found.\n\nJust before he’s completely out of the office, Grant dares a look back, to sight Omar—still eyes wide with the surprise of betrayal, but starting to look toward Grant. And in that moment, between the two men, a flicker in Omar’s face says, I’m sorry. He let a wolf into the house without knowing it.\n\nTime speeds up as Nathan steps out, closing the office door behind him and firing off two rounds into the cubicles where Grant had last been seen.\n\n“Let’s not do this dance, Lukather,” Nathan barks. “The hide-and-seek. I don’t like it. Don’t have time for it.” Grant hears him stalking through the office maze, checking under desks and peering over partitions while Grant keeps low and rounds a corner. “The longer it takes me to find you, the more annoyed I’ll be. That will determine how much pain you’ll suffer before the lights go out.” Then: “I already had to kill a marshal for this jacket. I’m tired. Stand up now, give yourself a noble end. You deserve that for all you’ve done.”\n\nGrant finds his desk. Keeping low, he quietly pulls at one drawer.\n\nIt sticks. With only a two-inch gap.\n\nFrom elsewhere in the office, Nathan continues his hunt. “Visiting Leonard this morning was a big help, you know. You activated all of us.” Nathan kicks at a chair and rolls it into another cubicle. The partition wall near Grant shudders from the reaction.\n\nGrant flattens one hand and reaches into the drawer, searching.\n\nHis fingers scrape something metal and heavy.\n\nNathan steps into view and sees Grant.\n\nGrant kicks at his chair to distract Nathan, but the man posing as a marshal sidesteps. Grant frees his hand from the drawer and starts to move again, but this time he’s too exposed, he has no hard cover or easy escape route, and before he’s taken a step, Nathan shoots him.\n\nThe bullet punches through the fatty part of his left leg, but the impact feels like a baseball bat to his thigh. Grant crumbles just as he was getting up.\n\nHe rolls onto his back. Starts to crawl away, still looking for an escape. All the while Nathan stares placidly at him. “You’re lucky. I don’t have any ash with me. Simon is running late. If this had timed out, it would have been you and every other version of you out there in the world. Bowling pins.” Nathan shrugs. “You aren’t going to tell me what I need to know, are you?”\n\nGrant’s body trembles against his will. He’s entering shock. But his eyes are locked on the barrel of Nathan’s gun.\n\nWith a furious defiance, Grant tells him, “No.”\n\n“Figures.”\n\nNathan points the gun at Grant’s head, and a gunshot cracks loudly through the office. Nathan falls back, blood spouting from his neck.\n\nOmar stands at his office door, his shirt soaked with his own blood, wheezing his last breaths, but with his own service handgun aimed steadily at where Nathan had just been.\n\nGrant gets up and first disarms Nathan, who’s fallen onto his back, eyes wide, gurgling from his neck wound.\n\nGrant picks up Nathan’s weapon and points it down at the man.\n\n“I’m coming for the rest of you.”\n\nNathan’s eyes shine. He grins, even now. “Good luck,” he sputters.\n\nGrant kills him.",

      "content": "18. Chess Moves in the Dark\n\nCHESS MOVES IN THE DARK\n\nSarah stares at her phone while Marigold drives. The freeway ahead is a line that slices into the dark of the shadows of the Rocky Mountains, hiding the sun behind them. Both women are stressed, their muscles taut with tension. Marigold seems to study each car on the road with them as if it were a venomous creature, changing lanes to give them a wide berth from other traffic. After Sarah puts the phone to her ear for the fourth time and goes back to staring at it in her lap, Marigold breaks the silence.\n\n“Did no one pick up?”\n\n“Not yet.”\n\n“Not even Grant?”\n\n“He told us he had to take a flight to D.C. to sit down with his boss. To keep us safe.”\n\n“I don’t feel safe.”\n\n“He’s likely still on the plane.”\n\n“Or he’s dead.”\n\nSarah whips her head to stare daggers at Marigold. “Why would you say that?!”\n\n“We don’t know—”\n\n“He’s not dead!”\n\n“Okay, okay. He’s probably still on the plane.” Then: “What about Brian? Have you tried him?”\n\n“Multiple times.”\n\n“His cell number?”\n\n“That’s what I’m calling.”\n\n“Try the precinct. Maybe he’s in a meeting.”\n\n“I’ll keep trying, please, just—just keep driving to Boulder.”\n\nMarigold drives. Sarah calls into Denver’s main police directory and bounces around in the phone’s system until another operator transfers her to Brian’s desk. The phone rings. It eventually goes to voicemail. Sarah leaves a message. “Brian, this is Sarah, please call me back right away, it’s super-important, please. You have my cell, I left you a message and a text on yours as well, okay, call me.”\n\nThe women are quiet for a moment.\n\n“What do we do when we get there?” asks Marigold.\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“We don’t have guns. I don’t know about you, but I don’t even know how to use one.”\n\n“Me neither.”\n\n“So our hope is stopping Brian and his partner before they enter the building where they’re ambushed. Right?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“But right now they believe I’m a fraud. And you’re implicated, too, if what you found out from our session is true.”\n\n“… Maybe.”\n\n“Sarah.”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“You won’t charge me for this trip, will you? My insurance wouldn’t cover it.”\n\nA hiccup of silence passes before Sarah laughs at the joke. Marigold joins her, and hearing each other laugh makes it funnier. Their stress momentarily leaves them.\n\nMarigold lets out a long breath, and her smile slowly fades. The somber reality of their situation returns to its stranglehold on her anxiety. After a time, she asks Sarah softly:\n\n“What happens to me?”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“If they kill Brian. With the—with the ash. What will happen to me?” she asks again quietly, having already played through this scenario in her head a dozen times. What would it feel like? Would I simply collapse? Would I feel pain from Brian’s death before dying as well? Is it instantaneous? Can I fight it at all?\n\nSarah stares out at the turnpike. At the future they’re driving toward. “I don’t know.” A moment later she follows with “And I don’t want to find out. So we’re just going to have to stop Brian and his partner from walking into that ambush.”\n\nMarigold concentrates. “A woman with a distinct nose, and a man with rimless glasses.”\n\nSarah nods. “That’s how you described them.”\n\n“I can still see them.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Since you regressed me, back in the hotel. This time, I can remember. I can see their faces if I close my eyes. The girl with the ponytail, too.”\n\n“That’s good, I think. Maybe because we’ve had so many sessions this week, or maybe because it’s so close to Brian…” Sarah trails off. She’s trying to sound knowledgeable, but the truth is they are both deep in uncharted waters.\n\nMarigold enunciates her next question with the clarity of someone grappling with a brand-new fear. “Is the killer doing what we are?”\n\nSarah tilts her head at Marigold. “Driving?”\n\n“Peering into a simultaneous life to see the future.”\n\nFor a moment Sarah recalls what Brian’s killer said, just before pulling the trigger. Say good night, Sarah. She shudders in her seat. It’s the one detail she didn’t share with Marigold.\n\n“I have no idea how they’re doing it. Probably just like we are.”\n\n“So … they’re coordinating after seeing what the future shows them?”\n\n“That’s probably how they got the jump on two homicide detectives, yeah.”\n\n“But if we succeed in saving Brian and his partner, it will change the timeline and they’ll feel it, just like I felt it when they changed Brian’s.”\n\nSarah’s eyes widen. “Um. Well.”\n\n“And then they’re going to look again, aren’t they? And see how we foiled their plans. And then counter us again.”\n\nSarah’s head starts spinning with the theoretical time-travel-without-traveling. She wants to cry. She wants to call someone for help. She wants to talk to her mother again. The whole reason she sought the supernatural world in the first place was because of Mom. Believing in something bigger, enigmatic, and spiritual was a source of comfort for her for so many years. And now, facing the truth of it, the messy terror of it, Sarah wonders if she chose the wrong life path. If, in pursuing the question of a heartbroken girl, Sarah has somehow pulled away the veil of reality and doomed them all.\n\nThrough that self-abuse, fear, and guilt, a new thought seizes her. A path to a potential victory.\n\n“Hang on,” she says. “Let’s consider this. You reacted so terribly earlier today, it was around eleven in the morning.”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“When I regressed you and learned Brian will be killed tonight, after the shock of it I got myself together and pulled you back to see what Brian was doing at eleven in the morning.”\n\n“Right. That was when he got the call that lures them to Boulder.”\n\n“Exactly. That’s when a choice Brian made altered his timeline. Which is why you felt it.”\n\n“Okay. I guess? So?”\n\n“So,” Sarah continues, “going by that logic, if we don’t interfere with the killer’s plans until just a few minutes before they’re supposed to ambush Brian, they won’t see us coming.”\n\nMarigold chews on this thought for a long moment. “I get it. We won’t be giving any of them headaches with enough notice to change their strategy before saving Brian.”\n\n“Exactly.”\n\n“But that means getting close to the killers. That puts us at the apartment building, Sarah. Near at least four versions of the killer. Right?”\n\n“Well. Yes. It would.”\n\nBoth women go silent again.\n\n* * *\n\nGrant takes the exit ramp out of the parking garage in Omar’s sedan too fast, and it rattles the suspension when the tires land hard on the street. Omar coughs, bleary, in the passenger seat, his breath shallow and wheezing.\n\n“We’re on our way, Omar. Howard University Hospital is close. Just stay with me.”\n\nOmar’s mouth moves as he tries to speak, but he can’t find the breath for it.\n\nGrant’s left leg burns and complains. Blood has formed a thick, wet line down the outside of his pant leg. Grant uses his left hand to keep pressure on it when he doesn’t need both hands to drive.\n\nThe car roars as Grant takes a side street, barreling toward Fourth. Omar reaches out and grips Grant’s sleeve. He holds on to it tightly; almost menacingly. Grant steals a glance over at Omar and catches the fierce gaze boring into Grant.\n\n“I’m here,” Grant says, and tries to make it sound comforting as he screeches around a corner. Omar tugs at Grant’s sleeve as he pulls himself toward him.\n\nThrough bloody, gritted teeth, Omar says into Grant’s ear, “Deserve … better.”\n\nWide-eyed, Grant looks back at him. “What?”\n\nOmar manages to complete what he’s working so hard to say. “You. Deserve. Better.” He coughs again, spattering blood on Grant’s coat, and manages, “Than this life.”\n\nIt takes every ounce of strength to tell him this, and Omar’s body simply relaxes into death in the passenger seat.\n\nGrant touches Omar’s shoulder and shakes him. “Boss.”\n\nOmar doesn’t move. His eyes grow distant and too still.\n\nGrant tries to rouse Omar again, his attention peeling off the road for a moment until headlights wash over them and an engine revs just before Grant notices and the world explodes around him—the airbags balloon out of the dashboard and the hood crumples and peels back to cover the windshield and a child’s empty lunch box from the back seat seems to levitate behind Grant until it bounces off the touch screen.\n\nThe seat belt has kept Grant in place, but the sudden kinetic trauma reverberates through his entire body.\n\nHis vision blurred, Grant can hear the sedan has come to a complete stop, its engine hissing and clicking, the electronics having completely shut down, throwing Grant into darkness inside a cadaver of a car.\n\nA figure approaches in the smoke and the flickering lights. Grant hears a voice.\n\nIt’s a man with white hair, wearing a jogging suit and a long coat.\n\n“That was revenge for Edgar,” he says.\n\nHe opens a small tin of shoe polish.\n\nGrant has trouble focusing. “Who … are you?”\n\n“This body is named Simon. I am the end bulb in the string of lights that starts with Edgar. So what that means is, when you tug on the string, when you ruin the freedom Edgar was supposed to have, all of us feel it, but I feel it the most. I’m at the end.”\n\nHe mashes his thumb into the shoe-polish tin, then snaps the tin shut, revealing a smear of ash covering his thumbprint.\n\n“I vomited up my dinner and blacked out last night, because of you. So we’re going to put a stop to your rude interruptions once and for all.”\n\nGrant’s foggy mind electrifies into a moment of clarity, and he kicks the door open, slamming it into this new assailant. Simon falls back and bashes against his own wrecked car, surprised by Grant’s sudden burst of energy.\n\nBy the time Simon stands back up and returns to the car, ready to fight, all he finds inside is Omar’s body crumpled in the passenger seat.\n\nSimon shouts into the night air, “Where are you going to go, Grant?” As the words bounce between the quiet industrial buildings flanking the side street, he adds, “You’re outnumbered, you know?”",

      "content": "19. An Unfair Fight\n\nAN UNFAIR FIGHT\n\nSarah and Marigold sit in their parked car in a darkened garage. Marigold has backed up into a spot deep in the shadows of a back wall, where the two of them have a direct line of sight to the bank of elevators and the stairwell door that leads up to the apartment building where Brian has been summoned. They watch from the dark as residents return home from work. One young woman is dressed in a costume as a pop idol, in shiny fabrics, clutching a plastic microphone. A short man with a scarf wears a jacket over his bumblebee costume.\n\nWith the foreknowledge that Brian will soon be shot to death in the corridor of this apartment building, as witnessed by regressing Marigold back in the hotel barely two hours earlier, the two find themselves hyperalert. Sarah realizes she’s tapping her thumb to her fingers in sequence—a steadying habit she did as an eight-year-old when her father would get home from work and slam the front door. She recalls once more the short story of the girl with the house full of water with the shark father swimming around and peers out the windshield at the glass door to the building’s stairwell. It’s all underwater here, I bet.\n\n“How long until the ambush?” Marigold asks.\n\n“Thirty minutes. We’re barely ahead of them.”\n\nIn the quiet, Marigold has a thought that makes her chuckle to herself.\n\n“What?”\n\n“Just thinking. This is twice we’ve been on a stakeout. Not exactly what I had expected of my life a week ago.”\n\n“Me neither.” Sarah remains serious; anxious. “Let’s review the plan once more.”\n\n“In ten minutes, I dial nine-one-one. I say I just saw a man in a biker jacket enter the building with a gun in his hand, and now there are screams coming from upstairs.”\n\n“I’ll follow up with an emergency call of my own, so it gets prioritized. With a decent response time here in Boulder, police should get here in five minutes.”\n\n“That gives us a cushion of about fifteen minutes between the local police arriving and Brian. For a call like this, they’ll hang out and ask around if any neighbors called it in.”\n\nSarah nods. “From there, we can intercept Brian when they pull up and make him listen to us.” She and Marigold keep their eyes trained on incoming traffic to the garage as they talk.\n\nMarigold adds a moment later, “It’s a flimsy plan.”\n\n“If you have any better ideas, I’d abandon this one in a heartbeat.”\n\nBut neither woman has a better idea. This one barely came together amid their shared anxiety bordering on panic.\n\nA new vehicle pulls into the garage. A minivan, its rear window jammed with clothes, children’s toys, and small boxes. As if driven by a hoarder.\n\nClimbing out from the driver’s side is a severe-faced woman in a business suit, lugging a grocery bag.\n\n“Is that the woman who held Brian down, in your vision?”\n\nMarigold’s knuckles whiten as her grip tightens around the steering wheel. “I believe it is. Yes. The faces are starting to get murky in my memory, but I’d swear that’s her.”\n\nSarah watches as the woman goes around to the other side of the minivan, where a teenage girl climbs out of the passenger side and helps the woman with the groceries.\n\n“That can’t be a coincidence. It has to be those two.”\n\n“Where are the other two?”\n\nThe phone rings in Sarah’s lap, startling her. She yelps, causing Marigold to yelp in reaction. By the second ring, Sarah has a grip on the phone and checks the caller.\n\n“It’s Brian. I should answer.”\n\nMarigold puts her hand over the phone to stop Sarah. “Don’t. Not yet. We haven’t called anything in!”\n\nSarah starts to argue the point, but Marigold’s eyes widen and she doubles over in her seat, clutching her head. “What’s wrong?” asks Sarah, her worry intensifying.\n\nMarigold winces, her body reacting once more like it did this morning at the hotel.\n\n“Let’s put you in the back seat, come on—” Sarah opens her car door to quickly come around and pull Marigold out, but the moment the door opens an inch, it’s yanked open and Sarah is dragged out of the car by her hair, her arms flailing in a mad panic, seeing briefly the expression on Marigold’s face as she looks over at Sarah while another figure steps to her door.\n\nThe young man in the biker jacket throws Sarah down and pins her arms to the concrete of the darkened garage and presses his revolver against her cheek. “Quiet, now.” In an instant, Sarah freezes in place, holding her breath.\n\nFrom the car, an older man yanks Marigold out and punches her in the gut, causing Marigold to fold onto the parking garage floor. Sarah sees a sliver of her from her viewpoint through the underbelly of the car.\n\nBiker Jacket leans close to Sarah, whispering, keeping the revolver against her face. “Brian finally listens to all your voicemails. We all felt it like a tremor—we knew you’d changed our little plan for him.” He smiles wide, revealing teeth full of silver fillings. “You foolish woman. He wasn’t our big fish. You were.”\n\nHis eyes shine as he smiles.\n\nSarah can’t speak, can’t even feel her extremities for a moment. She tries to will her body to move, but it won’t respond to her through the white noise of paralyzing fear. The young man’s breath smells like sulfur and rusted copper, and he gazes down at her the way a cat does an insect, with a mischievous grin.\n\n“Get her up and bring her inside,” says the older man, hefting Marigold in front of him. “We’ll wait for Huntley and his partner to get here.”\n\nBiker Jacket pulls Sarah to her feet, all the while keeping the revolver touching her, and the four march toward the elevators.\n\nThe teenage girl and the severe woman wait for them, holding one elevator open.\n\n* * *\n\nGrant hides among the machinery of a four-color printing press inside a darkened industrial-shop floor. He’s wrapped his leg with a work rag he found at a color station, but it has barely stanched the bleeding.\n\nIt feels like it’s been half an hour. He doesn’t know precisely because his phone launched out of his pocket and landed who knows where when Simon’s car collided with him. Ten minutes ago, he heard Simon rattling doors, checking for any already unlocked. A few minutes ago, he spotted a silhouette at a high window, using a flashlight to peer into the printing shop, sweeping it around in search of Grant. Grant stayed hidden. His training tells him that when you’re physically debilitated, the best option is to hide somewhere secure and wait out your opponent. Grant is betting on this.\n\nHe can feel the dizziness and nausea creeping into his body from the blood loss. Grant weighs his options. With considerable effort, he stands up and limps over to the door he used to slip inside—and promptly locked behind him when he did. He listens at the door, but hears nothing.\n\nFinally, Grant pushes outside and scans the street for any sign of his attacker. Mercifully, he’s alone.\n\nAnd immediately he’s on the move. Limping toward Fourth Street, and the drone of traffic. Leaving the wreck behind him.\n\nAs he approaches the intersection, a skinny man bundled up in a coat steps to the crosswalk, focused on his phone. Not paying attention to the world around him.\n\n“Help,” Grant sputters, and realizes his voice has cracked.\n\nIt’s enough for the pedestrian to look up from his phone and see Grant, and then the remains of the car wreck half a block back. The skinny man’s eyes go wide and he hurries to Grant’s aid. “Oh my gosh, are you okay?”\n\n“Call the cops, please,” Grant pleads hoarsely.\n\n“Do you need an ambulance? Is that blood?”\n\n“Please.” Grant looks around for any sign of Simon.\n\n“Of course. Is it just you? Anyone in the cars?”\n\n“Just me.” Grant can feel his body starting to shut down from the stress.\n\nThe man makes a call, keeping an arm on Grant to keep him steady. Grant faintly hears a voice on the other end, then the skinny man says curtly, “Simon, I found him at Fourth.”\n\nThe alarms go off in Grant’s head, but he’s too slow to react—the man quickly turns and kicks Grant right in the wounded leg, causing Grant to fall hard to the sidewalk.\n\nGrant can feel the pull of the dark, the foggy space between sleep and consciousness where time flits by in a blink. Grant struggles to stay awake. When he blinks the world back into focus, Simon towers over him, talking with the skinny man.\n\n“If they look this way, just shout at them to call for help. I will act like I’m performing CPR.”\n\n“Fine,” says the skinny man. “But make it quick and quiet.”\n\nSimon opens his small tin and smears ash on Grant’s forehead.\n\nGrant feels Simon’s knees on his arms at the elbows, keeping him from squirming away.\n\nSimon stares down into Grant’s eyes as he clicks open a slender pocketknife. “No more snooping from you.”\n\n* * *\n\nSarah hyperventilates behind the duct tape wrapped over her mouth. She and Marigold sit tied to wooden chairs in a cramped kitchen of the apartment where Marigold saw Brian get shot and killed. She overhears the conversation in the front room:\n\n“We finish them off now, we still have time to prep for Allen, and we won’t have to worry about Brian.”\n\n“It’ll be another tremor.”\n\n“But then it’s over. It’s the smart move.”\n\n“She’s right.”\n\n“I still think we should question them. If they’ve told anyone else about this, it will cascade.”\n\n“If that were true, it would already be cascading. The future would be overwritten ten, twenty, a hundred times a day. As it is, we barely remember what it should’ve been, before we took over.”\n\n“And we can’t stay in control if someone else has the same autonomy. You know that.”\n\n“Is Martin at the shrink’s office? Do we know if he’s done it?”\n\nBiker Jacket speaks up. “He texted the group chain, yes. He can’t get into the filing cabinets where her client records are.”\n\nSarah holds her breath. Is someone in my private office back home?\n\nThe older man says flatly, “If he doesn’t have a crowbar, tell him to douse it all. Better to make it look messy than surgical.”\n\nThe severe woman’s voice snaps, “Enough. Finish them off.”\n\nSarah looks to Marigold, who’s listening with wide-eyed terror. Tears flow down her face, over her tightly taped mouth.\n\nSarah pulls at her restraints. Tries twisting her wrists behind the chair to loosen the tape binding her.\n\nBiker Jacket steps into the kitchen and casually steps toward them, grabbing a pouch the size of a dice bag from the counter on his way.\n\nHe dips one finger in the pouch and then applies a dollop of ash to Marigold’s scalp. Marigold screams with clenched eyes, but the tape smothers the sound of her cry. Just as casually, the young man applies ash to Sarah’s forehead, running his finger down to the bridge of her nose.\n\n“I wanna do it,” says Teenage Girl. She holds out a hand at Biker Jacket.\n\n“Not the gun,” he scolds her. “We have to be softer now.”\n\n“Softer is slower,” she pouts, but digs into her backpack and pulls out a switchblade. “Which one first?”\n\nThe severe-looking woman steps into the kitchen, a cigarette in her long fingers. “Get the therapist first. We want the detective in the building when he drops, so we can deal with his partner.”\n\nTeenage Girl shrugs, clicks the switchblade, and grabs Sarah’s chin with her other hand. Sarah screams, “Wait wait please,” as loud as she can, but it comes out as vague squeals through her gag.\n\nTeenage Girl tilts her head. “No big speeches for you, lady. Or for us. Pray you bleed out quickly.”\n\nShe rears back with the knife, her eyes shining with excitement.\n\n* * *\n\nGrant stares up at Simon, the glint of Simon’s knife between them. Once more, time slows. He knows he’s looking into the eyes of the same monster inhabiting Edgar Troy, and Leonard Church, and the fake Samaritan who tricked Grant, and who knows how many others. This is the same man who taunted Grant at a maximum-security prison. But the only other people who know about this—the only others who would even believe such a preposterous claim—are thousands of miles away.\n\n“Bowling pins,” Simon says, smiling. The tip of the knife sinks into Grant’s ribs, tearing the fabric of his dress shirt.\n\nGrant’s mind races to flood his system with the last his body has to offer, and that offering is this reminder:\n\nOmar’s card trick.\n\nHours of practiced sleight-of-hand work to produce the concealed card from the cuff of his wrist. “It doesn’t have to be a big move, just a quick one,” Omar once said.\n\nGrant whispers, a smile forming on his face.\n\n“What’s that?” Simon demands, leaning closer, moving the knife to Grant’s throat.\n\n“There’s always a trick.”\n\nGrant headbutts Simon, their foreheads cracking together, and when Simon recoils—feeling immediately that some of Grant’s ash has now smeared onto his own head—Grant performs the trick, twitching his wrist and pinching his thumb and finger.\n\nThe holdout pistol he took from his desk leaps into his palm.\n\nWith a deft turn of his wrist, he fires the gun right at Simon’s face.\n\nThe weapon makes a loud pop, like a balloon bursting, and Simon’s left eye turns into a crimson hole in his head.\n\nSimon’s body spasms, then falls over, onto Grant.\n\nNext to him, the skinny man collapses as well. His face wide with shock. His glimmering eyes fading to gray.\n\n* * *\n\nTeenage Girl crumples to the floor like a marionette, and her switchblade rattles to a skidding stop on the linoleum tile. Beside her, Biker Jacket falls, his eyes graying. From the living room, Sarah hears the thumps of two other bodies collapsing.\n\nSarah and Marigold stare in shock, in horror, and then in hope. Holding their breath.\n\nNone of their abductors stands up again. None of them takes another breath.\n\nThe only sound in the apartment is the TV.\n\nAnd then, after an eternity within a minute, a voice from the end of the kitchen calls out to Sarah and Marigold.\n\n“What the hell are you two doing here?”\n\nBrian stands at the open door.",

      "content": "20. Two Weeks Later\n\nTWO WEEKS LATER\n\nWhiplash is the word Sarah uses to describe it. After Halloween night, it was a brief stay at a Denver hospital for supervision and treatment of her light wounds. Then a series of interviews with Detective Huntley, the FBI, Homeland Security, and someone from the National Board of Psychology. No press. The chief of police, backed by multiple agencies, issued a media blackout to give them “time to sift through the rubble” of the Ash Killer case and figure out what really happened. The same Halloween night that Brian found Sarah and Marigold bound and gagged in the Boulder apartment with four “very random” people dead at her feet, two more names joined the body count on the list: Edgar Troy, who was still incarcerated in a local Denver jail, and Leonard Church down in ADX. Both of them—like the four strangers on the floor of the apartment—were determined to have died of a sudden stroke. No other explanation could be drawn. Most of them had no drugs or alcohol in their system. One had early signs of heart disease, but it was clearly not the culprit. The FBI wasn’t satisfied and took over the case, determined the Bureau would find some sort of toxin all six of them had taken at the same time, like a cult, to take their own lives.\n\nThe next day, two more bodies were added to the tally of sudden-stroke victims that same night, this time all the way in Washington, D.C. Texts from their phones revealed a plot to track and murder Grant and his superior with Predictive Analytics.\n\nNone of the investigators could put it together. This group of eight otherwise unconnected people operated as a unit, with their phone numbers in one another’s call history, but the FBI could not find a moment when these eight could have met for the first time, where they were recruited, or how they knew so much about Leonard Church and the special ash he used. That same ash was found smeared on the forehead of Simon Carruth—one of the bodies found in D.C. He had a tin of it in his jacket pocket. Forensics matched it to the same ash Leonard Church used on his victims. The same used by Edgar Troy in Denver.\n\nAnd then a ninth conspirator joined the growing wall of diverse faces, this one not suddenly dead from cardiac arrest or stroke, but rather from a gunshot wound. Nathan Hawkes. He had been impersonating a US marshal. Recovered emails and text logs revealed his activation by Simon Carruth the day before, with a specific mission to murder Grant’s supervisor at Predictive Analytics and potentially Grant as well, should Simon fail at intercepting him earlier.\n\nWhere it really took a turn for investigators was in the discovery of a tenth collaborator.\n\nMartin Ashton was his name. He was the only one of the group whose profile Grant was authorized to access before the entire case was escalated to a higher confidentiality. Martin grew up in Houston, but moved to San Diego after high school. He landed work in a physical rehabilitation practice while pursuing his degree in occupational therapy. His focus was on reading people’s bodies to diagnose what muscle groups needed help; where they were weak or carrying trauma; how stress was knotting them up or reducing their range of motion. This was a tool to help diagnose patients in occupational therapy.\n\nAccording to journals Martin kept in his apartment, chronicling each year of his life from the age of eighteen, this was when his fascination with the concept of pain grew to obsession.\n\nEight years ago, when Martin was nearly thirty, he committed his first murder. No ash, no signature left behind or personal effect stolen as a souvenir. But it awakened something in Martin. In his journal entry, he described the act as the most exhilarating experience he’d ever had. His victim was a perennially optimistic Hindu woman named Adya Choudhuary, whose temperament quietly infuriated Martin at the food court where he’d overheard her conversations.\n\nTwo weeks later, Martin attended Adya’s memorial service. He knew it was risky, but he was chasing the high and wanted some last vestige of the feeling to return. In the brief moment he stayed, he overheard Adya’s sister say that Adya would be reborn to live a better, longer, more fulfilling life filled with joy. It was what she had earned.\n\nThis worldview invaded Martin’s thoughts. It soured his experience. What he wanted was for his actions to matter. If there was a scoreboard, he wanted this logged as a win on his side and a loss on the other. Reincarnation suggested the scoreboard reset, every time. Frustrated, Martin began poking around in the darker parts of the internet for validation that the world, on a spiritual level, didn’t work like that. The Christian community was fully ready to deny all forms of reincarnation, but that felt less like applied science to disprove the theory and more like propaganda to help them cling to their own.\n\nIt’s when he posted in a small subreddit about how pointless it felt if a person could just be reborn again, like a video game character respawning—that’s when Martin was visited by another member of the collective. Joshua Cordova. The young man who restored motorcycles, and one of the four bodies found in the Boulder apartment.\n\nMartin’s journal entries turned more cryptic from this point, but they showed signs of his indoctrination into the cult, for lack of a better term, of these disparate individuals. He joined their private social groups and text chain. He was given a small tin of the same ash the others were using, as a remedy for the frustration he felt with his “first time.” And so he began killing again. But for Martin, in San Diego, he tried a new practice, to distance himself from any association with Leonard Church: He cleaned off the smear of ash from his victim’s forehead after applying it when he killed them. This kept him off the federal radar for when he couldn’t suppress his hunger.\n\nOn Halloween day, Martin received a four-minute call from Joshua Cordova and two hours later made the drive from San Diego to Santa Monica, where he stopped at a home improvement store, then waited until dark and broke into Sarah’s office, emptied a two-gallon container of turpentine onto the furniture of her suite, then set it ablaze. That’s where his body was found, having collapsed shortly after starting the fire. Using alarm timings and forensics, authorities placed Martin’s sudden stroke at around the same time as those of the four in the Boulder apartment, Edgar Troy, and Leonard Church.\n\nThe stack of coincidences and unexplained relationships drove FBI investigators mad. They hounded Grant even before his release from the hospital. How did he know the killers? What was his involvement? How were these apparent strangers all connected, to perform a series of choreographed crimes in different parts of the country, including the apartment of a rather anonymous but severe-looking woman named Victoria Gable in Boulder, Colorado? How was this connected to the murder of Grant’s superior? And most of all, why?\n\nFBI investigators haunted Grant, Sarah, and Marigold for days, repeating the same questions again and again. The answers were all simple and aligned. Marigold was a nascent psychic who’d begun having visions. She didn’t know what brought them on and wasn’t convinced they were mystic powers until she went to see Sarah, and the two of them began exploring the significance of the visions. Grant became involved the moment Sarah called to warn of a vision of Marigold’s while in therapy, and the three of them went to Denver to try to figure out what kept pointing Marigold to the Ash Killer copycat case.\n\nGrant confessed he had little evidence to provide. He was sure the Denver trip would be fruitless, and whatever strange predictive prowess Marigold might have would soon become unreliable, just as in countless cases he’d checked into before.\n\nAnd in a sense, he was right. After the night of Halloween, Marigold confessed she’d lost her second sight, or whatever had given her visions. Unsatisfied, a team of federal agents put Marigold in a secure room and pushed her to re-create the circumstances that typically prompted a psychic vision of the future. None arrived. They brought in Sarah next, to apply her therapeutic methods in hopes of a different outcome. What was attempted in these sessions remained confidential, even from Grant, but the results were deemed inconclusive. Without any of her records having survived the fire, the FBI could only interview her assistant, Tahlia, for contextual clues as to the nature of Sarah’s therapy. And Tahlia pointed out she was never privy to any of her boss’s therapy sessions, for obvious legal reasons.\n\nIn their formal report, temporarily accessible to Grant with his credentials, the FBI task force determined this to be an extremely rare case of a group of criminals working as a team, in a relationship as intensely intimate as a cult, operating almost entirely over secure social media apps and phone texting. Other evidence was located in the homes of these individuals, pointing to a “deeper connection” between them all, and a fascination with transcendental meditation and the afterlife. A separate case file documenting “items of commonality or synchronicity” among the homes of the ten was made top secret, and not even Grant could gain access to it. Whatever had been found had spawned a new line of investigation, with a separate team. It was around this time that the FBI’s attention toward Marigold, Sarah, and even Grant waned. They were, as far as the investigation was concerned, minimally related to the killers, beyond the extraordinary moments of precognitive clarity Marigold experienced.\n\nReporters hounded the police for information, running with salacious and unfounded stories in the absence of facts. Two reporters even managed to track down Sarah and leave voicemails pleading for an interview, aware she was a “person of interest” to the case somehow. After the first week, the fervor among the news channels seemed to die down, and their focus turned to new stories. Sarah went home. To Travis.\n\nTravis had not been a ghost this entire time—Sarah recalled the day he showed up at the hospital in Denver, worried sick, with a bouquet of flowers from the gift shop on the first floor. He was confused, concerned, and just wanted to bring her home, but she was at the start of her marathon of interviews with every tier of law enforcement and was not allowed to leave town. After a long discussion with him the day she was released from the hospital, Travis agreed to return to Santa Monica and wait for her return. And at the end of the first week of November, she was allowed to go home.\n\nHer second week of November focused on wedding plan- ning.\n\nTravis had been “scared to action,” as he called it. The thought of losing her had driven him to more than just committing to the wedding date. He was eager to show her off at parties, meet her clients, and even consider letting her put him on her couch—something he had said was a deal-breaker when they first started dating. Gone was the little passive-aggressive tone buried under his blanket of assurances and farewell kisses. Finally, the Travis she had always hoped he would be was here.\n\nWhiplash.\n\nBut a welcomed one. A needed one, Sarah felt, after the intensity of October. She wanted to fully submerge in normalcy. For every call from her lawyer, or an FBI investigator, or an unknown number that didn’t leave a message, Sarah filled her time and attention with something mundane. Something cute and personal. Something that reminded her she’s safe now, she’s not trapped in a car defending herself against a man with a knife, she’s not tied up in a dingy kitchen with four serial killers. Those moments don’t define her. Sarah returned to her Santa Monica home with the dishwasher door that sticks, and the neighbor’s cat who loves to come by and visit, and her fiancé, who brings home takeout from their favorite ramen restaurant.\n\n* * *\n\nThis morning, she descends from the bedroom to the aroma of eggs, butter, and sizzling bacon. The toaster pops just as she enters her kitchen to find Travis wearing an apron, plating an omelet. “Hey, love. I made breakfast,” he says with a peck on her cheek.\n\n“You didn’t have to! Although this looks delicious, thanks.”\n\nHe leads her to the breakfast table and puts their plates at their seats. “This weekend is the big dinner at Pete Wabash’s place. Lots of lawyers, a few movers and shakers. No pressure at all if you don’t want to go, but I have to make an appearance. And I’ll get a lot more attention if you’re with me.”\n\nSarah smiles at Travis. “I think I can do that, yes. Just let me know how dressy it is, so I can figure out what to wear.”\n\n“Oh, for sure. It’s not superfancy, but maybe we both dress up a little, and if it’s too much, we can say we’re going to the theater after.”\n\n“It’s a date, then.”\n\n“Fantastic.” He grabs a slice of bacon and talks as he chews. “You will be the one everyone wants to see, anyway.”\n\n“Oh, I doubt that.” Sarah blushes slightly. Travis hasn’t been this romantic since their first three dates.\n\n“I don’t. The whole office is fascinated by the Ash Killer case. Obviously, don’t feel like you need to tell my boss anything confidential.” Travis shrugs. “But then again, if you want to share, it would earn us a lot of clout.” He beams at her. “Up to you, of course.”\n\nSarah’s heart sinks. He’s not talking about her appearance turning heads. It’s only her role in a national case currently shrouded in mystery that has Travis eager to put her on his arm.\n\n“Right. Well, I don’t think I can say anything I haven’t already.”\n\nTravis nods. “That’s probably for the best.” He leans back. “Are you seeing him?”\n\nThe sudden question rattles her. “What?”\n\n“The Fed. Mr. Predictive Analytics. Isn’t he finally in town for that wrap-up with you?”\n\n“Yes. This afternoon.”\n\n“Good. Well. The offer still stands. If he bothers you, just shoot me a text. I can make a call.”\n\n“It’s over. The case is closed.” She adds quietly, “I’ll be fine.”\n\n“I’m proud of you, Sarah. Even if I don’t understand what all happened.”\n\nHe touches her hand. She smiles in return.\n\nTravis claims the last piece of bacon and steps away from the table. “I’m late. See you tonight.”\n\n“Okay.” But her eyes remain on the small plate where the bacon had been.\n\n* * *\n\nThe David Ireland House sits at the corner of Capp Street and Twentieth in San Francisco. It’s home to an eclectic collection of conceptual and installation art. Grant takes in warm-colored walls and rustic hardwood floors. He spends several minutes studying an exhibit of a chair stuck in a wall, seemingly hovering over a bundled circle of brooms. He tours the rest of the house, leisurely following a tour group.\n\nLater, at the curb, Grant pulls out a small leather notebook, wrinkled from repeated use, and opens it to a slip of paper with Charlotte’s list.\n\nAll the homes of American artists she wanted to see have been crossed out, save for one. Number four. David Ireland.\n\nGrant marks a line through the last entry, having fulfilled some unspoken promise to himself. He was braced for an emotional catharsis when this time came, but now that it’s here, he feels simply at peace. He wanted to do this thing for her, or for him. It’s done. Charlotte left a lot unfinished behind her, including the painting her sister gave to him, but this list of destinations—this is what Grant could do. And it’s done.\n\nGrant checks the time on his phone. Adding in traffic on the Pacific Coast Highway, and an overnight stay to clean up, he should be at Sarah’s door by breakfast tomorrow.\n\nHe climbs into his new sedan. It still smells of the auto plant. The odometer seems embarrassingly low. His last car saw past two hundred thousand miles before it met its end with Sarah at the wheel. But everything is new now. A new chapter. A new position in his career. A new car.\n\nGrant pulls away from the curb and heads south.\n\n* * *\n\nAs the morning hours crawl by, Sarah finds herself moving closer to the front of the house. She chooses to sort the mail on the dining table. She finds the shoe station by the front door too messy and cleans it. She clears out her old projects from the art room and opens the blinds to let in some light. It just happens that those windows offer the best view of the driveway to their house.\n\nShortly before ten thirty, Grant’s car pulls to the curb. He climbs out and walks with the aid of a cane for his left leg.\n\nSarah greets him at the door. He looks older than she remembered him. Clearly, he is older—they both are—but he has a weariness to his eyes today. She’s seen this before in some clients who’ve experienced deep trauma.\n\nHe smiles as he steps up. “Sarah. It’s been too long.”\n\n“You left me high and dry in Colorado, you know.”\n\nBut she smiles back. They shake hands awkwardly, feeling a pull to some sort of physical greeting more than something so businesslike.\n\n“It’s not like we haven’t spoken on the phone nearly every day since.”\n\n“Come in, I made coffee.”\n\n* * *\n\nThey sit in the freshly decluttered dining room with two cups of coffee before them. Sarah hands Grant two packets of the sweetener he always uses. He thanks her.\n\n“How is Marigold?” he asks.\n\n“She’s good! Well. As good as can be after that. I have my last session with her tomorrow, then it’s only if she calls me and asks to be put back on my calendar.”\n\nHe nods, thankful. “I’m relieved.”\n\n“She said it’s better if we don’t look to the future too often. She trusts me, and she mostly trusts you, but still … she doesn’t want to tempt fate. Literally, in this case.”\n\nGrant considers how much Marigold must have come to understand about her simultaneous life with Brian. How fragile the future is. “I agree. But I also know she’s our only window into what fate has in store. It will be difficult for me not to reach out to her the next time there’s a criminal making national news.”\n\n“I think that’s why she said she mostly trusts you.”\n\n“That’s fair.”\n\nThey each choose to sip their coffee, like a tiny intermission before venturing into the serious discussion. Sarah breaks the silence first.\n\n“She kept to the story, the entire time. So did I. No one knows what we know.”\n\n“Yeah. I believe it. Or else we’d all be in a very different situation right now. Did they ask anything that felt like a real threat?”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“I mean if you or she ever felt the FBI was dangerously close to catching you in a lie.”\n\n“Me? A couple of times. You know the warrant you said you could get if you had to, to get access to my client records? They were ready to go there. Except, you know.”\n\n“The fire.” He shudders. His personal history with fire causes an alarm to trip in some part of his brain whenever he thinks of the word.\n\nShe nods. “I guess we weren’t the only ones worried about keeping this thing a secret.”\n\n“The killer wanted it all to himself.” Grant corrects, “Themselves.” And then again: “I don’t even know the right pronoun to use in this situation.”\n\n“Do you think he’ll come for us again?”\n\nGrant takes a long breath, punctuating it with, “I think if he had the ability to connect with his other selves, and communicate with them at an early stage, none of what we managed to do would’ve happened. Maybe I wouldn’t be alive now, or you simply wouldn’t have met Marigold. He would’ve stopped that. So, in a war where time itself is a weapon, who wins is still a matter of timing.” Grant doesn’t mean for it to sound like a joke until it’s out of his mouth.\n\nSarah finds it funny and laughs. After another quiet moment, she offers, “You know Marigold’s symptoms are gone. No more missing time, no blackouts, migraines … She feels right with the world.”\n\n“Good. I’m glad you could help her.”\n\n“We. We helped her. None of this would have worked out without you.”\n\nGrant gazes at her with a gentle smile, but searching eyes. Sarah begins to feel flushed by it. “What?” she prompts.\n\n“And how are you doing?”\n\n“Me? Oh, I’m, I’m well. You know they don’t even think I’m going to have a scar from the knife wound, if it heals right. I’ll have nothing to show for my act of heroism.”\n\n“I can send you the steering wheel of my old car if you want a souvenir.”\n\n“You saved the steering wheel? Of course you would. You really love driving.”\n\n“I do.”\n\nBefore the silence runs away from them, she asks, “How about you? Are you okay?”\n\n“I am.” He takes a breath. “Oddly, knowing there is more to this universe has—I don’t know, stilled some part of me that had been a little anxious before this.”\n\nSarah smiles. “Me, too.”\n\n“Are you still going to practice?”\n\n“Of course. I have more clients than ever now. I have a new office, two blocks from the old one. Business is good. For both of us, I hear.”\n\n“I’m only acting director for now.”\n\n“Uh-huh. Come on, Grant. Who else are they going to get for that? They can call it a cult or whatever, you’re still the agent who cracked the case.”\n\n“Well. Maybe.”\n\nThey sip their coffee.\n\n“They’re closing your case file next month. So you know. Some profiler at the FBI will continue to look for corners of the internet where Leonard, Edgar, and the others could have been convening, to see if there are more still in the wild, but for now, they have nothing else. No other leads, no living suspects. Just some personal effects in the various homes of the killer that confound investigators, but that’s it. So.”\n\n“So?”\n\n“So maybe you can feel good about moving on from it.”\n\nSarah nods, aware Grant is here not to interrogate her a final time, but to provide her some respite from the trauma of what happened.\n\n“You know, I did two very specific searches after Halloween.”\n\nGrant studies her, unsure where this is going.\n\nSarah continues, “The first was a query on hospital networks across the country. I looked to see how many other people just keeled over from ‘sudden stroke’ or similar diagnosis at the same time of death as our killer.”\n\nGrant nods. “I did a similar search on federal databases. And?”\n\nShe shrugs. “Couldn’t really be sure about any others. I think this soul—whoever was inhabiting all those bodies—it was all hands on deck for them.” She idly adds creamer to her coffee. “And anyway, if the ash works the way you told me, we evicted him everywhere at the same time. He—she—they, ahem, can’t be walking around in the body of a twenty-year-old. If they come back, if they’re reborn into this world again, it would have to start after Halloween. Or else they would have been evicted from the body the moment you shot that guy in D.C.”\n\nGrant rubs his forehead. “I follow you. But it still hurts my brain.”\n\n“Oh, me, too. I’ve just been thinking about it enough it doesn’t hurt as much anymore.”\n\n“Yeah. I wouldn’t know where to go from here, anyway. So I’m happy it’s over.” And then he prods, “What was the second search?”\n\n“The one you asked me about. How many people out there have been experiencing symptoms like Marigold.”\n\n“And?”\n\nSarah sighs. “There were … a lot.” Then, second-guessing herself: “I mean, maybe. But there are plenty of other illnesses that can cause those symptoms, too.”\n\n“I guess all you can do now is just be on the lookout. Not just with Marigold, but with any other patients you treat.”\n\n“If I do run into this again, can I call you?”\n\n“I’d be hurt if you didn’t.”\n\nThey share a smile. Grant looks away briefly, and Sarah sees his smile vanish from his face. He clears his throat and stands up. “Well. You have plenty to do, and I need to get on the road.”\n\nSarah walks him back to her door, feeling like their visit got cut short.\n\n“Maybe this isn’t the last time we’ll work together,” she tells him.\n\n“I don’t know. Maybe we should be hoping we never see each other again if it means the future is secure.” He sees the sadness in Sarah’s eyes and feels a pang of guilt. “I sound like a character in a time-travel movie now, don’t I? I just meant, let’s hope reality doesn’t break again and we’re the ones left trying to fix it.” He shakes his head, laughing to himself. “That sounds just as bad.”\n\n“I know what you mean. Yes.”\n\n“Well.”\n\nSarah adds, “But…”\n\n“Hmm?”\n\n“But if you’re ever in my neck of the woods again, let me know?”\n\nHe smiles. Shakes her hand again. It’s just as awkward this time, too. “Take care, Sarah.”\n\nAnd then he’s gone.\n\nSarah watches him drive off until his new car is out of sight. She shuts her door and leans against it for a moment, replaying the conversation in her head. What suddenly prompted Grant to cut the visit short? She moves back into the dining room and picks up their coffee cups to clean them, then her eyes wander to what Grant must have seen at the end of the table.\n\nA bridal magazine.\n\nOh, it reminded him and scared him off, she thinks. Quickly followed by What am I doing, anyway? I’m getting married. My pull to Grant is trauma bonding, that’s it. I’m a therapist, I know about these things. I’m happily engaged now.\n\nSarah finishes cleaning up and steps into her art room, where an easel and a paintbrush stand occupy one corner. She ties her hair back, opens her paint swatches, and puts the final touches on her latest project.\n\nA painting of a tree in a field of flowers.\n\nHer work in oil on canvas depicts an old, large willow tree in the early sun, presiding over a field of poppies. While it stands in the center of the piece, the most striking element is just to its side, under the canopy: The silhouette of a romantic couple, holding hands and staring off into the morning sun.\n\nSarah hums to herself, unaware she has not created an entirely original work. Unaware this is the completed painting Charlotte had left unfinished.",

      "content": "21. Most Memorable\n\nMOST MEMORABLE\n\nThe metronome pulses softly. On Sarah’s therapy sofa in her new office on Montana Avenue, Marigold lies on her back, her eyes closed, her breath deep and steady. Sarah sits upright in her chair nearby, speaking softly but confidently.\n\n“Feel your body release all tension. Starting at your feet. And traveling up your legs, and your back, to your neck. Let it out in a breath. Six. Five.”\n\nMarigold sighs.\n\nHer body seems to sink a fraction into the sofa, as her muscles unclench.\n\nSarah gives her another breath to recede further into this state. “As you drift into a peaceful trance, you feel that ribbon around your waist. Four. Three.”\n\nMarigold’s body goes perfectly still.\n\n“This binds you to the conscious world. But you are free. Two. One. Pull it loose.”\n\nMarigold’s hand moves gently, her fingers slightly spreading, as if releasing something from her grip.\n\n“Now, return to who you were before Marigold. Fall into that life.”\n\nMarigold’s back rises, she lets out another breath. And then:\n\n“I’m there.”\n\n“Tell me who you are, and where you are.”\n\nSarah looks at her digital recorder on the table, its timer ticking up, the visualizer dancing every time Marigold or Sarah speaks.\n\n“I am Brian Huntley. I am very old. But I am cared for here.”\n\nSarah smiles. Marigold’s voice sounds closer to a man’s voice again. Now that Sarah has heard Brian speak in person, she can tell how closely Marigold sounds like him. But this is not the same introductory dialogue Sarah got from Marigold before. Sarah refers to Brian’s entry-point information in her therapy journal: Brian Huntley. 68 years old. Nursing home. Dying of cancer. August 2057.\n\n“What is the date?”\n\nMarigold’s head lulls to the side, as if looking at Sarah.\n\n“December. A Friday.” Then: “Luda passed away last year on this same day. Wouldn’t it feel right if this is when I go?”\n\nSarah is ambushed by this sentiment, feeling a sudden pang of emotion. She sets it aside and follows up with “What year?”\n\n“December of 2071.”\n\nSarah blinks. He lives longer? She jots that question down in her pad. Is this a result of some choice he made in his life?\n\n“Are you dying of lung cancer, Brian?”\n\n“No, I gave that up long ago. But, yeah, it probably would’ve killed me. I’m just … old.”\n\nSarah writes new timeline next to this journal entry and circles it.\n\n“Brian, I want you to focus now. This is an important question. In your entire life, what is your most memorable moment? What is the first thing that comes to you when I ask that?”\n\nMarigold frowns in her trance. “November 2024.”\n\nSarah hastily writes it in the margin. A year from now?\n\n“Go back there. Live in the moment. Tell me what you see and hear.”\n\n“It’s pouring outside. He’s at my door again. Shouting in the rain.”\n\n“Who?”\n\n“Grant Lukather.”\n\nSarah leans forward, suddenly nervous. “What is he shouting?”\n\n“I have a message for Sarah.”\n\n* * *\n\nGrant stands at Brian’s door at seven in the morning, drenched, eyes red from crying, pleading. A fresh scar marks a line across his left cheek, like he got in a fight recently.\n\nBrian faces him in his bathrobe, his hair askew from sleep.\n\nWhen he speaks, there is the slightest echo of Marigold’s voice in his, as if she were in another room, narrating his dialogue in sync. “What? What message?”\n\n“You have to come back to this moment. To here and now. Whenever someone asks you what your most memorable moment is. Please. Do you understand?”\n\n“Okay, okay. Is that the message?”\n\n“No. Sarah needs to know—she needs to know, it’s spreading. We caused a ripple effect with the Ash Killer. We have to work together again right away and stop this.”\n\n“Grant, why are you telling me this? Why not her?”\n\n“Because she’s dead. They got to her. And I can’t do this without her. Sarah, please, you’re the love of my life and I need you to find me at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo in April, or it all unravels. Please.”\n\nBrian stares in confusion at Grant, as Grant falls to his knees and breaks down.\n\n* * *\n\nSarah stands in the middle of her office, trembling, eyes wet with fresh tears, her hand over her mouth.\n\nThe words had barely escaped Marigold’s lips when Sarah stood up rod straight. It’s all bouncing in her ears, setting Sarah’s mind racing. Of all the information she was just given—there are more cases, the future is broken, she’s somehow already dead in a year—the one she can’t pull herself away from is this confession:\n\nI’m the love of his life?!\n\nThe metronome pulses softly.",
